    <h1>Unanswered Questions</h1>

    <p>Below is a list of questions I wish someone would research and answer
    for me. I don't have enough Internet or physical clout to get people
    fulfill this request, but anyone who finds these questions interesting
    is welcome to steal them or email me with an answer. Who knows, these
    questions might spark an interesting discussion.</p>

    <p>And the obligatory "<a href="https://lmgtfy.com">Let Me Google That
       For You</a>".</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How often are nutrition facts reevaluated? What is the acceptable
            tolerance of the data?</li>
        <li>Why do we <em>crack</em> jokes? What is the etymology of this
            term?</li>
        <li>How do people with advertisements or business information on their
            cars prepare their cars to be sold? Do they get another paint job
            over the business paint? Do they sell it as is? Do they never sell?
        </li>
        <li>Why is economic growth necessary? Every resource on economics
            I've ever read, every business books, even <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/geoffrey_west-why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-and-people-always-die-and-life-gets">this article I really like</a>
            assumes growth to be the end-all-be-all.</li>
        <li>How much of a construction site is cleaned before the pretty,
            normal-human-use pieces are put in? How do you protect a
            construction site from rain and other weather phenomena, like
            tornadoes or hurricanes?
        <li>How do you maintain airflow in underground structures? For example,
            parking garages and tunnels. The more general question is, how do
            construction companies build underground structures?</li>
    </ul>
