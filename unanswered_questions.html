    <h1>Unanswered Questions</h1>

    <p>Below is a list of questions I wish someone would research and answer
    for me. I don't have enough Internet or physical clout to get people
    fulfill this request, but anyone who finds these questions interesting
    is welcome to steal them or email me with an answer. Who knows, these
    questions might spark an interesting discussion.</p>

    <p>And the obligatory "<a href="https://lmgtfy.com">Let Me Google That
       For You</a>".</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How much of a construction site is cleaned before the pretty,
            normal-human-use pieces are put in? How do you protect a
            construction site from rain and other weather phenomenon, like
            tornadoes or hurricanes?
        <li>How do you maintain airflow in underground structures? For example,
            parking garages and tunnels. The more general question is, how do
            construction companies now build underground structures?</li>
    </ul>
