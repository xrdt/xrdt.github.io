  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <p>Some questions I don't know the answers to.</p>
  <p>Would appreciate pointers to references which can help answer or
     some philosophizing on the right answer.</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Has economic mobility significantly changed over time?</li>
      <li>What is the expected lifespan of human organs? I read somewhere
          on the Internet that lungs are expected to last 60 - 70 years but
          our brains could go to 120 years?</li>
      <li>What is the embodied energy cost of popular motorized vehicle
          transport mechanisms?</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Since my questions page is not very intersting (yet), here are some
      other people's questions pages.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><a href="https://patrickcollison.com/questions">Patrick Collison,
            co-founder of Stripe</a>. I really like his first question.
      </li>
  </ul>
