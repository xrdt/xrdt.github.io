    <h1>Books, Readings, and Other Sources of Information</h1>

    <p>I believe the print book is far better than the digital version.
       The flashing of a screen slows down your reading speed and distracts
       you.</p>

    <p>Some excuses for reading digital books are that digital books are
       cheaper and more portable. You could also say that reading free pdfs of
       books is a good way to sample the work before you decide to buy it.
    </p>

    <p>I would argue that there is no need to have your entire library on your
       person at every moment of every day in your Kindle or other e-book
       reader. How often are you reading 100 books at a time? How often are
       you reading 5 books at a time? How often do your books take up so
       much space or weight in your luggage that you seriously need to
       consider leaving them at home? Each moment you spend reading should
       be one of deep concentration and immersion. Do not treat reading as
       some fickle, temporary activity you do to appear smart. When you read,
       you are enriching your mind by diving into the author's universe.
       Cherish that moment, because it is impossible to recreate.</p>

    <p>If you want to sample books, go to your local library. If you are too
       don't want to buy books, use your local library. It is
       rare that one re-references books, anyway. There are few books in this
       world that are worth owning. Save your money for those books.</p>

    <p>If you like the command-F/ctrl-F of your favorite PDF reader or eBook
       reader, let me inform you that you can find passages in books very
       efficiently after you've read them.</p>
