  <h3>My Philosophy on Work</h3>
  <p><a href="https://xrdt.github.io/2018/08/26/three-factors-work.html">People, Projects, Growth</a></p>

  <blockquote>The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is
              great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what
              you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't
              settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you
              find it. --Steve Jobs</blockquote>
