  <h3>Positions I am Interested in</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Ones where I get to work with good people</li>
      <li>Ones where I can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality">Quality</a> in my work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I think the most important predictor of how well an experience goes is
     how you judge the quality of the people you're sharing the experience
     with. Counting grains of sand on the beach in 100% humidity and over
     100 deg Fahrenheit weather can be enjoyable with the right group of
     people. It's a hard thing to determine who is good, but it doesn't
     have to be hard to stick around those people or keep those people
     around.</p>

  <p>I can't say I fully understand my second criterion, because I don't
     fully understand Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality, but I do want to
     develop a certain kind of passion for and dedication to my "craft",
     whatever it ends up being.</p>

  <p>The most fundamental criterion for having a good life is to
     want to be alive.</p>
