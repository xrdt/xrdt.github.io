  <h3>Username Trickness</h3>
  <p>I go by XDRT, not by XRDT. XDRT was unavailable, so I created XRDT 
  as a compromise.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>I am a student at Caltech studying computer science and business, 
  economics, and management.</p> 

  <p>My major interests are in data analysis and quantitative finance, 
     particularly in algorithmic trading. Other interests include:
     data visualization, virtual/augmented reality, resource management, 
     and AI chatbots.</p>

  <p>You can learn more about my thinking and preferences by going to my thoughts page.</p>

  <h3>About This Website</h3>
  <p>This website is being built by scratch using Jekyll and Github Pages.</p>
