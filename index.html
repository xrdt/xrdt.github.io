  <h3>Username Trickness</h3>
  <p>I go by XDRT, not by XRDT. XDRT was unavailable, so I created XRDT 
  as a compromise.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>I am a researcher who focuses on machine learning and data science 
  projects. I have experience working on developing sentiment analysis tools 
  for financial applications, a web scraper which could process around 8 
  articles a second off Yahoo and Google Finance, 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfyv3dGBF6E&feature=youtu.be">data visualizations and analyses in VR</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/xrdt/BEM150_Final">data analysis for traffic 
      accidents in NY City</a>, and a tool for detecting clusters of 
  suspicious voter registration activity. Details on my work are on my 
  <a href="https://xrdt.github.io/projects.html">featured projects page</a>.</p>  
  
  <p>Contact info is on <a href="https://xrdt.github.io/resume.html">my resume</a>.</p>

  <p>I am also a student at Caltech studying computer science and business, 
  economics, and management.</p> 

  <p>You can learn more about my thinking and preferences by going to my <a href="https://xrdt.github.io/thoughts.html">thoughts page</a>.</p>
