  <h1>This is XDRT's website</h1>
  <h3>Username Trickness:</h3>
  <p>I go by XDRT, not by XRDT. XDRT was unavailable, so I created XRDT 
  as a compromise.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>I am a student at Caltech studying computer science and business, 
  economics, and management.</p> 

  <p>My major interests are in machine learning and quantitative finance, 
     particularly in algorithmic trading. Some other interests include:
     data visualization, virtual/augmented reality, resource management, 
     and AI chatbots.</p>
  <h3>Purpose of This Website</h3>
  <p>To showcase my thinking.</p>
