So far, I have completed two of my three university recruiting sessions:
UCSD and Stanford. Because I am a Caltech alum, I will be going to their
career fair on Tuesday, October 15. That day happens to be the first day of
our [Beyond](https://www.thoughtspot.com/beyond2019) conference.

My coworkers and I felt like UCSD did not yield great candidates. Most of the
people coming to talk to us were interested in doing machine learning or data
science, roles which we are not currently hiring for. Beyond that, many of the
candidates did not have strong experiences or give a feeling of having strong
potential. It is hard to judge a candidate off a resume, but a sense of
quality can be determined from the conversation.

Airbnb had an astonishingly long line all day at UCSD. People were waiting
over an hour just to talk to representatives. UCSD recently implemented a
shift system, so students were assigned 1-hr shifts in which they could roam
the gym. It's not a particularly good system for students or small companies.

Stanford was higher yield, even compared to Berkeley. This is likely because
we went to the CS specific fair at Stanford. It's a more expensive fair, but
the curation may be worth the extra dollars. Nvidia and Bloomberg had the
longest lines. It's a bit confusing to me why Bloomberg attracts so much
attention. A coworker attributes the interest to NY and higher salaries. I'm
not sure the salaries are higher after adjusting for cost of living. Nvidia
has a clear value proposition for all the bushy-eyed and bright tailed
students who want to become immersed in deep learning, but you'd better know
your material if you want to get past the engineers who will grill you on
the spot about LSTMs and memory consistency.

I appreciate that my company gave me the opportunity to be on the other side
of the hiring table this year. I still am highly confused about what I should
be looking for in candidates. I've seen some pretty good candidates, some
pretty bad candidates, and some maybe ok maybe not does anybody really know
candidates. Even the pretty good candidates I hesitate to rate as such,
because I don't trust my *instinct*. Instinct is the key word here. People
don't have good metrics by which they are judging talent. Even if they have
heuristics, they don't apply them consistently. What this results in is an
arbitrary evaluation scheme where people can get rejected because they didn't
do one small thing correctly, like "smart pointers", or "they didn't indent
with 4 spaces" or "they don't follow the same OOP principles as me", which
are just utter BS reasons to turn a candidate away.

People like [Joel Spolksy](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) have written about
[interviewing](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)
and [how to find great people](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/) but the industry is still so so confused about what it
wants its team to look like. The industry approaches the issue of hiring in
the way colleges approach admissions: apply lots of broad and dumb heuristics
that will get you safe, homogenous hires but will likely miss out on great,
eccentric talent.
