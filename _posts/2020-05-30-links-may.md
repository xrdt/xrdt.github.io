This page is being updated nearly every day throughout the month of May. Expect
a similar page for subsequent months.

Books:
* [Sum: 40 tales from the afterlives](https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Tales-Afterlives-David-Eagleman/dp/1491503629)
  * This book was useful for entertainment purposes only.
  * There were a only few sentences I found profound.
* [Siddhartha, by Herman Hesse](https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Novel-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845)
  * Another book for entertainment purposes only.
* [Impro](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178)
  * Found this through [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/01/23/impro-by-keith-johnstone/).
  My notes [here](../26/impro-notes.html)
* [Chop Wood Carry Water](https://www.amazon.com/Chop-Wood-Carry-Water-Becoming/dp/1483441784F)
  * I read this book because it's on [Ben Greenfield's Recommended list](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/ben-recommends/).
  I found out about Ben through the [HVMN podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWKSeJ1-ULI&feature=youtu.be),
  where he gave a very high level overview of what ancestral biohacks he's
  stacking to upgrade his life.
  * This book is motivational fiction. It follows a series of stories between
  a guy who moves to Japan to train for 10 years to become a samurai archer and
  his archer sensei. The main pieces I took away from this, which aren't
  anything new but go so against the conventional hubbub and IG / Twitter /
  whatever the f\*\* social media you like to ingest in gallons these days
  "I live a high leverage, highly successful life" that it's helpful to dive
  into a book like this and emerge refreshed, are [here](../21/chop-wood-carry-water.html).
* In the middle of 黑暗森林 (Dark Forest), the second book of the Three Body
Problem series. I still can't say I'm a big fan of LiuCiXin's writing, but I
want to know how the story unfolds!
* [One Straw Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/One-Straw-Revolution-Introduction-Natural-Classics/dp/1590173139)
  * Another recommendation from [Ben Greenfield's Recommended
  list](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/ben-recommends/). My notes
  [here](../26/one-straw-revolution-notes.html).

Podcast:
* I actually listened to [Ben's conversation with James on potential errors in
how tech people have been anticipating technological paradigm shifts and the
firms that would appear to take advantage of or build
them](https://stratechery.com/2020/exponent-podcast-the-water-we-swim-in/)
in April, but I forgot to put it on last month's record. They discuss [The End
of the Beginning
article](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/), where Ben lays
out an argument about how firm dominance is established early on in the
development of an industry and how the move from batch processing to continuous
computing is not a paradigm shift. Rather, bach processing and continuous
computing exist on the same spectrum, a spectrum which the dominant firms of
today are best equipped to handle. He's implying that we aren't going to see
any upstart companies uproot Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or Google, just like
there weren't any upstarts to uproot Ford, Chrysler, and GM from the pinnacle of
American automobile manufacturing in the 1920s. This just means that new
startups and the next dominant set of firms will be looking to establish their
roots in a world where computing is taken as a given, rather than as a
destination.
  * They also discuss the idea of path dependent development in the podcast.
    That is, look at how credit cards have developed around the world. America
    got them first, when Bank of America dropped a bunch of them in Fresno in
    1958. Then Europe pulled out chip and PIN credit cards, technology that
    the US largely hasn't adopted. Then China decided, screw you white people
    and your plastic cards; we're going to use smartphones directly. While we
    can argue that the trend is always in the same direction of turning the
    physical cash into digital bits and reducing frictions for people to throw
    their digital bits to the wind, there's no reason to assume the
    instantiation of that trend in any one location will be the same as the
    instantiation of that trend in any other location.
    * I think path dependence is a highly underrated idea and was so happy to
      them have an intelligent conversation about it!

Articles (Only the Worthwhile Ones~):
* I love this interview with Edge.org and Geoffrey West so much that I had to
read it again to soak up the goodness of West's insights into the power laws
that govern the growth of our urban environments. Read
[here](https://www.edge.org/conversation/geoffrey_west-why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-and-people-always-die-and-life-gets).
I wrote notes about the article
[here](../10/geoffrey-west-edge-cities-die.html).
* [Quantitative Approach to Product Market Fit](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/)
  * [Original](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc)
* Peter Thiel's
[The Straussian Moment](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay).
If you like Peter's thinking, you should pair that essay with this [interview he
did with the Hoover Institution on
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8). I wrote notes about the interview [here](../10/thiel-hoover-straussian-moment.html)
  *  ^ Related to Thiel's angle on tech and science stagnation is a good post from
  [Alex Danco on postmodernism](https://danco.substack.com/p/progress-postmodernism-and-the-tech).
  Postmodernism is the prevailing philosophy. It's a direct reaction against the
  "excesses" of modernity and drives the simulacra that we love to see in Whole
  Foods and Starbucks and other places that deliver "authentic" or "rustic"
  experiences (rather than the mass-produced, sterile experience of McDonald's).
  What exactly was the excess of modernity? From Wikipedia, most Western
  uses of modernism refer to the
  > trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve
  and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation,
  scientific knowledge, or technology.
  Modernism is about progress, about new, about Zero to One. Postmodernism?
  Well, it rejects modernism and Enlightenment rationality and focuses on
  relativism (reality is a mental construct), about innovation and management
  of risk (sound like the finance industry? Arbitrage, putting capital to work
  where the rates are highest...), about arbitraging constantly opening and
  closing windows of opportunity.
    * Alex sees Thiel and those who sympathize with his "anti-SV tech" stance as
    fighting a culture war against the postmodernists. The
    Thielians' view of the world is something like this: Silicon Valley is drunk
    on creating permutations on existing infrastructure. It's a flywheel of the
    same "stupid" pizza delivery apps and yet another container-based codeless
    web app deployed on some serverless platform. It's another market ecosystem
    app. It's another network effect driven app that's going dig so deep into
    our social networks that we won't be able to ever set it down.
* HackerNews thread on [experimentation in
biology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23236465)
  * Takeaways? There's not enough market demand in biology to drive
  commodification and massive open sourcing like there has been in 3d printing
  and drones. People don't like messing with biology because it's inconsistent
  and has long feedback cycles. Even if you want to get into biology, who do you
  trust? The biohackers who claim ingesting XYZ and sleeping 4 hours a night
  and shining infrared light on their balls increased their testosterone 4x? Or
  the FDA? Or other [independent couch researchers](https://twitter.com/gerdosi)?
  Accreditation is a hard thing in biology, but when there is a will, there is a
  way. The biggest barrier to people getting anywhere is themselves.
  * [Related group](https://www.thethoughtemporium.com) that is helping people learn science.
  * [Related company working on open source lab automation](https://opentrons.com).
* [Eric Weinstein and his brother Bret Weinstein retelling the story](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kast-media-2/the-portal-2/e/66665404) of Bret's supposedly Nobel deserving discovery
about a defect in laboratory mice telomeres and the DISC (distributed idea
suppression complex).
  * Eric gives a great warning about the content at the beginning of the
  podcast. The first chunk of the podcast is basically Eric being the
  overbearing older brother who harps on Bret for being too soft and
  accommodating and not ambitious enough. Bret was basically as obscure as a
  scientist could be until he caused some uproar over objecting to a day of
  racial segregation at Evergreen College, where he used to work. Eric is upset
  that Bret was never recognized for his obviously massive biology talent, that
  he went to work at a place that basically said "I'm not very good" and
  resigned himself to always be looked down upon by
  [famous biologists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzU-DoEV6k), that he
  isn't aggressive enough in pursuing success and getting himself acknowledged.
  It's scathing, and you can safely skip that first portion if you just want to
  hear Bret talk about his fascinating discovery around mice telomeres and
  cancer and [antagonistic pleiotropyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis).
    * I must say that Eric's criticism of his brother is largely the internal
    criticism I give towards academic friends. I feel like they're weird for
    being ok with a measly $30k salary, that they're not contributing or
    accomplishing in the same that way that people who go into industry do, that
    they're strangely soft and inclined to weird neuroticisms about acceptance
    and rationalist debates and caring about technical details of things that
    don't matter in the big picture that the highest profile people and thus
    most "successful" people care about.
  * [Rodney Brooks' take on peer review](https://rodneybrooks.com/peer-review/)
  and the associated [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23280372)
  discussing whether peer review is broken and what alternative mechanisms could
  replace it. Open source software pull request reviews are a proposal that
  could work. That sounds like an extension of the "original" editor driven
  review mechanism for journals which Eric is in favor of.

  * Get ready for a blast on politics and metis (local knowledge) and nihilism
    and some general nonsense writing about modernity. I've added a couple
    links below to help buffer Lou's writing.
  * I'm not sure I understood more than 30 - 40% of the articles. At some point
  I became fed up with Lou's writing and my inability to deeply understand
  what seemed like fundamental points he was making about narcissism and
  paternalism and gri-gri and tuned out. I'm convinced the solution is to dive
  into the books he builds his argument upon and some other philosophers, like
  Nietzche, because there's no way this blog series will compensate for my lack
  of philosophical bedrock.
  * A quote that's stuck with me because of how much stuff about identity and
  social media I've been reading lately.
  > In eighteenth-century London or Paris, sociability did not depend on
  intimacy. “Strangers meeting in parks or on the street might without
  embarrassment speak to each other.” They shared a common fund of public signs
  which enabled people of unequal rank
  to conduct a civilized conversation and to cooperate in public projects
  without feeling called upon to expose their innermost secrets. The romantic
  cult of sincerity and authenticity tore away the masks that people once had
  worn in public and eroded the boundary between public and private life. As the
  public world came to be seen as a mirror of the self, people lost the capacity
  for detachment and playful encounter, which presupposes a certain distance
  from the self.

    * [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)
  * This series made me reread Abe Lincoln's [Lyceum Address](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_3/The_Perpetuation_of_Our_Political_Institutions).
    * The main point of the speech is to heighten the citizenship's awareness of
    the possibility of insurrection from within. The forces that will topple
    America will not come from other countries, not even if they use the
    entirety of the world's energy. The greater threat is what happens if the
    populace submits to mob law. Then, if you follow Lincoln's slippery slope,
    eventually even innocent men's will be subject to the frenzy of the mob's
    passions. At that point, even level-headed men will become fed up with the
    government's inability to protect them from the mobs and side with the mob.
    * Lincoln's measure of safety against mob law is to ask each person so
    bolster his respect for and willingness to uphold the law.
    * Another threat, perhaps greater than mob law, will be an individual with
    ambitions on the other of Alexander or Caesar or Napoleon. To serve within
    the set structure of the American government and political system could not
    possible sastisfy these people. These people desire to explore frontiers, to
    forge their own paths. But, if the people are bound together in support of
    the government and its laws, they can foil the plans of someone who would
    deign to rise into power and exert his absolute will over those under him.
    * Effectively, the time of passion is over. Passion was effectively
    channeled during the Revolution, but now that there is no longer a common
    enemy to fight against, it is time to let society be governed by "cold,
    calculating, unimpassioned reason".
    * "Let those materials [(reason)] be molded into general intelligence, sound
    morality, and, in particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and
    that we improved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we
    revered his name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no
    hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that
    which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington."
* Social media stuff
  * Snap Researcher [Nathan Jurgenson](https://nathanjurgenson.com) on the
  [Liquid Self](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self).
    * I think it's fairly easy to see that people are fluid, that they change
    their behavior depending on the audience. I think it's also fairly easy to
    see that people want the freedom to put on masks and play a role. People
    like escaping to places where no one knows them and they can unleash a side
    of themselves that would contradict their main social circle's dominant
    perception of "who they are". Of course, you can take this a step further
    and say that there will always be people in society who are at risk of
    serious harm if they are seen under their "true" identity, the identity that
    is stamped onto their government issued cards. I agree with what Nathan's
    saying, and I find what Alex and other up on the latest tech news people
    are implying will happen with companies like Snap and
    [Fortnite](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) and
    [Disney](https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-why-disney-is-closer-than-ever-to-walts-60-year-old-vision)
    fascinating, but I can't help but feel that the applications of these
    fundamental "insights" about human beings are trivial, meaningless, even
    harmful? to the human experience. Call me jaded and naive and unwilling to
    [join the
    crowd](https://www.ft.com/content/dbc0e0c6-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a) and
    profit while the going's good... I suppose Thiel would say it's a mistake to
    retreat to the inner world and stop fighting for greater technological and
    scientific progress. We'll see where my jaded self goes.
    * Jurgenson on [Temporary Social Media](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/temporary-social-media)
      * There's a bit of "let's not get tied down by these permanent records"
      and "let's readd value to social media posts through planned scarcity

* [Interface Theory of Perception](http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdf)
  * My notes [here](../13/interface-theory-perception.html).
  * Led me to reread [this awesome
  paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.schres.2017.11.032) on schizophrenia and
  our ability to accurately perceive the timing of "control", or intention over
  our actions. Turns out our back-referral mechanism is a bit overeager and that
  schizophrenics (who have fewer filtering processes) may be right about not
  actually being in control of their actions.

  * It's been a while since I've read material from investing people that doesn't
  sound like total highbrow hogwash. The reason I'm ok with what they wrote here
  is probably because it includes specific examples, especially examples with
  companies that I've never heard of. I suppose you could say my brain is
  craving novelty that doesn't fall into the standard Bay Area categories of
  LessWrong Rationalism and Co; Slate Star Codex; software is eating the world;
  remote work will actually take over the world because COVID-19 made us wake up
  to the reality that working through our computers, not just on them is ok and
  is in fact better for us; what leaving the Bay Area was like for me; what
  moving to the Bay Area was like for me; startup shenanigans and memos; ship
  fast, ship faster, ship fastest. I'm sure I'm missing a couple categories
  of never-ending pollution that fills what ought to be the blue skies of my
  Twitter feed. Please let me know if you have some more categories to add here.
  I am being 50% facetious.
* [Operationalization and Transition to Zero-Sum Dynamics of of Silicon Valley's
   Dearest Software Businesses](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish)
  * Silicon Valley has exhausted the tailwinds of the market pulling for
  information on the Internet. There's too much content, to much to do, and
  already too much time spent on the Internet so the marketplace is shifting
  towards more competitive, zero-sum dynamics. This means a shift from R&D to
  SG&A and focus on building out operationally well-oiled teams of sales and
  marketing. New leaders will be well-versed in taking companies through the
  paces of new-market expansion and fundraising from non-VCs and IPOs rather
  than in building the next major operating system or technology platform. This
  means financial infrastructure like Goldman Sachs for Silicon Valley will
  emerge to help companies through the predictable stages of financial growth
  and take a cut off of the top. You can already see the players of the market
  acknowledging that value is shifting away from software problems to hard
  operational problems. Young people would rather become chief of staff or
  product managers than software engineers.
  * Alex Danco's [Debt Is Coming](https://danco.substack.com/p/debt-is-coming)
  fleshes out the implications of financialization nicely. The main part to
  pay attention to are that fact that recurring revenue from SaaS companies
  looks like fixed income securities. Finance is very, very sophisticated
  about fixed income securities, which means that more investors could get
  interested in securities based on recurring revenue. The other angle is on
  alignment between Carlotta Perez's Financial and Production Capital. Once
  founders and VCs stop playing with fake equity money (and dilution and
  decreased optionality from out of whack valuations) and refocus on putting
  money to work on creating customers and building their businesses, the
  salient, tried and true model of debt-financed growth will emerge. Of course,
  given how deep the connections between founders and VCs (financial capital)
  go in Silicon Valley, with founders often converting to angels viewing
  themselves as capital allocators with bets on the table generally just hanging
  out with the VCs, this conversion will likely not happen in Silicon Valley.
  New York, Tel Aviv, etc will probably jump on debt first.
  * Pair this post with [Scarcity Shifts, by Alex Danco](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/paradigm-shift-machine-part-1-technology-increases-access-to-what-is-scarce-1ed5cbc82537).
  My notes [here](../14/scarcity-shifts-danco.html).
    * Pair the Scarcity post with Alex's other famous series on
    [Scarcity: Emergent Layers](https://medium.com/swlh/emergent-layers-chapter-1-scarcity-abstraction-abundance-5705666e4f15). You can consider this Alex's OG thoughts on scarcity and
    shifts in the value chain. The main addition here is that he ties scarcity
    to the concept of being overserved, which comes from Clayton Christensen's
    theory of Jobs to be Done. A classic example is how Airbnb built a service
    that better served the young people who were being overserved by the hotel
    form of the scarce asset of places stay in interesting destinations.
* [Shared Value Businesses As an Alternative to Ad-Funded
Businesses](https://medium.com/@efeng/who-has-the-best-business-model-and-its-not-google-or-facebook-ca36f967bbd1)
  * Takeaway 1: Ads suck because no one likes watching them and because they
  don't deliver an appropriate distribution of returns across low-value and high
  value customers. The guy who watches 10x more content on Hulu also watches
  10x more ads, but those ads have rapidly decreasing marginal returns, so that
  content lover does not deliver 10x in value.
  * Takeaway 2: Freemium mobile games that run on in-app purchases are a prime
  example of shared value businesses. 2% of the users are high rollers and fund
  the continuation and improvement of the game for the 98% average users. Heavy
  Amazon Prime buyers subsidize the Amazon experience for the less frequent
  users.
  * Takeaway 3: You cannot escape the Pareto curve, so you may as well learn to
  leverage it by ensuring that you can capture monetary value from those 20%
  of high usage customers. Netflix cannot do this because every customer,
  whether they pull all nighters just to finish binge watching their favorite
  show or only use Netflix for their once a month movie night, pays the same
  price. Shared value works as a business model because nobody feels like they
  are getting ripped off. The people who like your product happily pay more
  for it. The people who don't pay the minimum and enjoy their minimum services.
  The passionate bring you enough money for you to keep improving your product,
  which makes everybody happier.

* [Endearing Channel where a guy explains how to do life right](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw/featured)
* [Structureless Organizations](http://www.struggle.ws/pdfs/tyranny.pdf)
  * A rather famous document written for the women's liberation/radical feminist
  movement in the 1970s. It's since been adopted by anarchist societies as a
  sort of charter on how to avoid falling into petty infighting and mere
  consciousness-raising rather than productive group action.
  * The basic premise of the document is that there is no such thing as
  stucturelessness, merely lack of formal structure. When there is no formal
  structure, elites, which are small friendship circles in the group, can come
  to dominate the group. These elites are not responsible to the group, are
  not given power by the group (elected or other means), are not invested
  in the group's productivity (because they formed on the basis of personality
  and background similarities that underlie most friendships), and are thus
  impossible to get rid of without imposing formal structure. If you allow a
  group to be forever dominated by elites, it will flounder and the members who
  either cannot join the elite or who actually want to get something done will
  go join other political orgs or just drop out entirely. The women who join
  other political orgs will form new friendship circles with people from the
  new orgs they join and become new elites that actually want to do more than
  get together for the sake of getting together, thus threatening the old
  elites. No matter, because unless you think the ideal form of the movement
  is weekly tea parties where you gossip about how ugly that person's hat is and
  who's seeing who, it's essential to build a formal structure that ideally
  follows the 7 principles Jo Freeman believes are essential for democratic
  structuring and political effectiveness:
  1. Delegation. "If people are selected to do a task, preferably after
  expressing an in- terest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment
  which cannot easily be ignored."
  2. "Requiring all those to whom author- ity has been delegated to be
  responsible to all those who selected them."
  3. "Distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible.
  This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority
  to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives
  many people an opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and
  thereby to learn specific skills."
  4. "Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too
  long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person’s
  'property' and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group."
  5. "Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. [...] Ability, interest and
  responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection."
    * I find "responsibility" to have an ambiguous meaning here. I instinctively
    want to say it is the person's ability to take on the relevant
    responsibility, but that should be covered under "ability". Could it be
    whether a person is responsible? That does seem to give a non-overlapping
    definition. What about whether they can be held responsible for the
    performance? That could also be relevant.
  6. "Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible.
  Information is power."
  7. "Equal access to resources needed by the group. [...]  A member who
  maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press or a
  darkroom owned by a husband) can unduly influence the use of that resource.
  Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills and information can
  be equally available only when members are willing to teach what they know to
  others.

elevate thinking](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be?stackedNotes=z6M8kex6kDF2FT6MWqAMDQddsqUr8sphLmyy1). As I've said many times in the past, good writing
comes from good thinking. Andy generalizes my words and says "good thinking is
the basis of good knowledge work". I recommend a perusal of the pages he's
collected.
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.brainstobytes.com/the-liskov-substitution-principle/)

the same as the superclasses. Also see [covariance and

New "Rogue Experts":
* Howard Marks
  * Howard Marks is not new in the sense that I've read his work for years now.
  He is new in that I've been dense enough to not have put him on the rogue
  experts list for years.

Interesting People:
* Sarah Tavel.

Things I Regret Buying:
* Coconut flakes from Trader Joe's. Only $1.99, yes, but they don't keep me
satisfied.
* Cheap Colby jack cheese from Safeway. I thought I could get away with a
cheaper price. My tongue has suffered.
* Sliced medium cheddar cheese by Lucerne. The flavor is entirely lacking.
* Goat Cheese. Honestly, I don't enjoy eating it that much. Not sure why I keep
putting myself through this torture.
* Trader Joe's Double Creme Brie. I really don't like the rind. I figured that
out the second time I bought the brie. At this point, I've probably bought
7 or 8 slices of that brie, and suffered every time I eat to the outer edge
and have to eat mostly rind. I prefer the Costco double creme that comes in a
wooden box.

Things I Don't Regret Buying:
* Trader Joe's Feta Cheese. I've bought it twice now. I like to crumble the
cheese into a tupperware and then eat spoonfuls of it with avocados and meat
or just by itself. I need to try their "authentic Greek feta" next time.
* Rosina's Meatballs! Tastier than the Costco ones and they don't have seed
oils!!

Things I Should Have Bought Earlier:
* Boursin. I didn't know Trader Joe's sold it!!

Very Cool Things:
* AI/ML/AR Copy paste to Photoshop

Television:
* Still watching [Person of Interest](https://www.netflix.com/title/70197042)
and still loving it. [Update 5/21/2020] Have started falling out of love...
* Stopped watching The Office. Don't see a reason to go back to it.

Movies:
* I tried watching [Rashomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon). Got
bored less than halfway through.

Manga:
* In the middle of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 4: Diamond is Unbreakable. I loved
Steel Ball Run and am so far also very happy with this Adventure.

Beautiful Places in the World:
* [Rainbow Mtn in Peru](https://www.rainbowmountainperu.com). The one thing
Windows 10 does well is sometimes show me nice background pictures on the login
screen.
  * Apparently CA/NV has a [similar set of colorful mountains in Death Valley](https://www.narcity.com/things-to-do/us/ca/artists-palette-in-death-valley-is-over-9-miles-of-rainbow-colored-mountains)

Random Notes On What's Happened in My Life:
* I've started recording prices for what I buy and where in a local spreadsheet.
It should help me answer "is this cheaper here?", especially when there are
coupons or sales involved.
* I rearranged the furniture in my room three times this month. The first
rearrangement was magical because it freed up a ton of floor space and allowed
more light from that albeit crappy wall light to shine into my room. The
second rearrangement wasn't ideal because the outlet placement in my room is
probably to code but nonsense. The third rearrangement is a minor adjustment
to the second and well, I'm not sure I can make things much better than this
right now.
* I use Twitter messages as my main way of transferring links and notes on
interesting readings between computers. I'm not convinced this is smart at all,
but I'd otherwise have to adopt better Git hygiene if I want to work on this
blog across devices...
* I had [chillblains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilblains) for the first
time in my life this past winter. I didn't have any symptoms other than
ridiculously itchy and slightly swollen toes. I first thought the itchiness
was due to my getting a mosquito bite while I was sleeping. I washed my sheets
and wiped down my sleeping area with a Clorox wipe. That didn't do anything,
because I'm pretty sure I noticed more little bumps that looked like mosquito
bites appearing on my toes. The itching was typically worst at night, especially
when I tried to warm my feet by keeping them in the covers.
  * Why did this happen? My house only has heating in the living room (honestly
  wtf am I paying rent for) and gets bloody cold in the rooms, which are as far
  from the living room as you can get in this structure. I hate wearing socks
  and felt like I could brave out the cold, as I'd done in nearly every previous
  winter I'd spent in a building with central heating (wtf). Guess my toes
  weren't up to the challenge.
  * The worst part about the chillblains was not knowing what they were for the
  first few days and suffering the itch. I'm pretty sure I found out what they
  were through Reddit.
  * Hopefully I can move into a decent structure when this lease ends and not
  have to suffer the lack of central air control this summer and winter.

New Exercise:
* Weighted Squat Jumps

Interesting companies and tools:
* [Nana Home](https://nanahome.com/about). Thumbtack/Angie's List for home
appliance repair (dishwasher, fridge, washer/dryer, oven, stove) but with
training (read, upskilling) for potential service providers.
* [Duffel](https://duffel.com). Was mentioned on Patrick O'Shaughnessy's (am I
the only one who can't spell or pronounce this last name properly) [podcast with
Chetan](http://investorfieldguide.com/chetan/). Some kind of GDS
dis-intermediator that allows travel agencies to [access airline's reservation

* [Journal](https://usejournal.com). We are still very much in the hype cycle
of productivity tools. I don't have a strong desire to try a new tool, but I'm
definitely keeping tabs on the RoamResearch Tweets.
