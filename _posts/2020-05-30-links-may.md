This page is being updated nearly every day throughout the month of May. Expect
a similar page for subsequent months.

Books:
* [Sum: 40 tales from the afterlives](https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Tales-Afterlives-David-Eagleman/dp/1491503629)
  * This book was useful for entertainment purposes only.
  * There were a only few sentences I found profound.
* [Siddhartha, by Herman Hesse](https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Novel-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845)
  * Another book for entertainment purposes only.
* [Impro](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178)
  * Found this through [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/01/23/impro-by-keith-johnstone/).
  * This is an amazing book by the #1 in improv, Keith Johnstone.
  * A brilliant quote on no discussions:
  > My feeling is that the best argument may be a testimony to the skill of the
  presenter, rather than to the excellence of the solution advocated. Also the
  bulk of discussion time is visibly taken up with transactions of status which
  have nothing to do with the problem to be solved.
  * I took theater in high school because I felt it was the easiest of the art
  options (orchestra, visual arts, a capella, etc). I never achieved any level of
  comfort with it and held onto a sort of apathy for theater for through
  college. This book has opened up a new vision of what training in theater
  could be like. High/low status games; masks to reveal what we repress (
  Johnstone reckons we "repress our benevolence and tenderness"); how to
  unlock our spontaneity and trigger unthought answers in our stage partners;
  blocking, accepting, and offering; learning to create stories on the spot; and
  generally working with a theater master to unblock our inhibitions.
  * In all of his exercises, Johnstone takes full responsibility for what
  happens to the students. It is only with the assurance that the teacher is
  there and will call things off when they start going off the cliff or that
  a student cannot be held responsible for embarrassing or obscene or grotesque
  things that emerge once their defenses are released can students fully
  immerse themselves into the power of their unconscious minds.
  * Venkatesh recommends this book more for its insights into social
  interactions and body language and psychology; I find it fascinating because
  of ties to unschooling and immersion in a more "natural" state of ourselves.
  This "natural" state can be preempted by masks. The objective of the masks is
  to get us to surrender control to a regressive force, one that is childlike
  and playful and takes in so much more of the world than we do with our
  standard ego defenses on. If you feel like surrendering your consciousness
  to a mask is a sign of madness, Johnstone would say:
  > the ability to become possessed is a sign of correct social adjustment, and
  that really disturbed people censor themselves out. Either they *can't* do it,
  or they're too afraid to even try. People who feel themselves at risk avoid
  situations where they're likely to 'go to pieces'.
  * Another good quote:
  > Once we feel that art is self-expression, then the individual can be
  criticsed not only for his skill or lack of skill, but simply for being what
  he is.
    * Artists used to be mediums through which gods, spirits, whatever operated.
* [Chop Wood Carry Water](https://www.amazon.com/Chop-Wood-Carry-Water-Becoming/dp/1483441784F)
  * I read this book because it's on [Ben Greenfield's Recommended list](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/ben-recommends/).
  I found out about Ben through the [HVMN podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWKSeJ1-ULI&feature=youtu.be),
  where he gave a very high level overview of what ancestral biohacks he's
  stacking to upgrade his life.
  * This book is motivational fiction. It follows a series of stories between
  a guy who moves to Japan to train for 10 years to become a samurai archer and
  his archer sensei. The main pieces I took away from this, which aren't
  anything new but go so against the conventional hubbub and IG / Twitter /
  whatever the f\*\* social media you like to ingest in gallons these days
  "I live a high leverage, highly successful life" that it's helpful to dive
  into a book like this and emerge refreshed, are [here](../21/chop-wood-carry-water.html).
* In the middle of 黑暗森林 (Dark Forest), the second book of the Three Body
Problem series. I still can't say I'm a big fan of LiuCiXin's writing, but I
want to know how the story unfolds!

Podcast:
* I actually listened to [Ben's conversation with James on potential errors in
how tech people have been anticipating technological paradigm shifts and the
firms that would appear to take advantage of or build
them](https://stratechery.com/2020/exponent-podcast-the-water-we-swim-in/)
in April, but I forgot to put it on last month's record. They discuss [The End
of the Beginning
article](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/), where Ben lays
out an argument about how firm dominance is established early on in the
development of an industry and how the move from batch processing to continuous
computing is not a paradigm shift. Rather, bach processing and continuous
computing exist on the same spectrum, a spectrum which the dominant firms of
today are best equipped to handle. He's implying that we aren't going to see
any upstart companies uproot Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or Google, just like
there weren't any upstarts to uproot Ford, Chrysler, and GM from the pinnacle of
American automobile manufacturing in the 1920s. This just means that new
startups and the next dominant set of firms will be looking to establish their
roots in a world where computing is taken as a given, rather than as a
destination.
  * They also discuss the idea of path dependent development in the podcast.
    That is, look at how credit cards have developed around the world. America
    got them first, when Bank of America dropped a bunch of them in Fresno in
    1958. Then Europe pulled out chip and PIN credit cards, technology that
    the US largely hasn't adopted. Then China decided, screw you white people
    and your plastic cards; we're going to use smartphones directly. While we
    can argue that the trend is always in the same direction of turning the
    physical cash into digital bits and reducing frictions for people to throw
    their digital bits to the wind, there's no reason to assume the
    instantiation of that trend in any one location will be the same as the
    instantiation of that trend in any other location.
    * I think path dependence is a highly underrated idea and was so happy to
      them have an intelligent conversation about it!

Articles (Only the Worthwhile Ones~):
* I love this interview with Edge.org and Geoffrey West so much that I had to
read it again to soak up the goodness of West's insights into the power laws
that govern the growth of our urban environments. Read
[here](https://www.edge.org/conversation/geoffrey_west-why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-and-people-always-die-and-life-gets).
I wrote notes about the article
[here](../10/geoffrey-west-edge-cities-die.html).
* [Quantitative Approach to Product Market Fit](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/)
  * [Original](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc)
* Peter Thiel's
[The Straussian Moment](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay).
If you like Peter's thinking, you should pair that essay with this [interview he
did with the Hoover Institution on
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8). I wrote notes about the interview [here](../10/thiel-hoover-straussian-moment.html)
* Silicon Valley is growing up....into finance?
  * [Article 1](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish)
  * [Article 2](https://danco.substack.com/p/debt-is-coming)
* [Uruk Machine](https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/)
  * Get ready for a blast on politics and metis (local knowledge) and nihilism
    and some general nonsense writing about modernity. I've added a couple
    links below to help buffer Lou's writing.
  * I'm not sure I understood more than 30 - 40% of the articles. At some point
  I became fed up with Lou's writing and my inability to deeply understand
  what seemed like fundamental points he was making about narcissism and
  paternalism and gri-gri and tuned out. I'm convinced the solution is to dive
  into the books he builds his argument upon and some other philosophers, like
  Nietzche, because there's no way this blog series will compensate for my lack
  of philosophical bedrock.
  * A quote that's stuck with me because of how much stuff about identity and
  social media I've been reading lately.
  > In eighteenth-century London or Paris, sociability did not depend on
  intimacy. “Strangers meeting in parks or on the street might without
  embarrassment speak to each other.” They shared a common fund of public signs
  which enabled people of unequal rank
  to conduct a civilized conversation and to cooperate in public projects
  without feeling called upon to expose their innermost secrets. The romantic
  cult of sincerity and authenticity tore away the masks that people once had
  worn in public and eroded the boundary between public and private life. As the
  public world came to be seen as a mirror of the self, people lost the capacity
  for detachment and playful encounter, which presupposes a certain distance
  from the self.
  * Seeing like a state book review from [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/)
    * Related post from [Scholar's Stage on Tradition being smarter than you](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html)
    * Cargo Cultism
    * [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)
  * This series made me reread Abe Lincoln's [Lyceum Address](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_3/The_Perpetuation_of_Our_Political_Institutions).
    * The main point of the speech is to heighten the citizenship's awareness of
    the possibility of insurrection from within. The forces that will topple
    America will not come from other countries, not even if they use the
    entirety of the world's energy. The greater threat is what happens if the
    populace submits to mob law. Then, if you follow Lincoln's slippery slope,
    eventually even innocent men's will be subject to the frenzy of the mob's
    passions. At that point, even level-headed men will become fed up with the
    government's inability to protect them from the mobs and side with the mob.
    * Lincoln's measure of safety against mob law is to ask each person so
    bolster his respect for and willingness to uphold the law.
    * Another threat, perhaps greater than mob law, will be an individual with
    ambitions on the other of Alexander or Caesar or Napoleon. To serve within
    the set structure of the American government and political system could not
    possible sastisfy these people. These people desire to explore frontiers, to
    forge their own paths. But, if the people are bound together in support of
    the government and its laws, they can foil the plans of someone who would
    deign to rise into power and exert his absolute will over those under him.
    * Effectively, the time of passion is over. Passion was effectively
    channeled during the Revolution, but now that there is no longer a common
    enemy to fight against, it is time to let society be governed by "cold,
    calculating, unimpassioned reason".
    * "Let those materials [(reason)] be molded into general intelligence, sound
    morality, and, in particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and
    that we improved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we
    revered his name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no
    hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that
    which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington."
* Social media stuff
  * Snap Researcher [Nathan Jurgenson](https://nathanjurgenson.com) on the
  [Liquid Self](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self).
    * I think it's fairly easy to see that people are fluid, that they change
    their behavior depending on the audience. I think it's also fairly easy to
    see that people want the freedom to put on masks and play a role. People
    like escaping to places where no one knows them and they can unleash a side
    of themselves that would contradict their main social circle's dominant
    perception of "who they are". Of course, you can take this a step further
    and say that there will always be people in society who are at risk of
    serious harm if they are seen under their "true" identity, the identity that
    is stamped onto their government issued cards. I agree with what Nathan's
    saying, and I find what Alex and other up on the latest tech news people
    are implying will happen with companies like Snap and
    [Fortnite](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) and
    [Disney](https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-why-disney-is-closer-than-ever-to-walts-60-year-old-vision)
    fascinating, but I can't help but feel that the applications of these
    fundamental "insights" about human beings are trivial, meaningless, even
    harmful? to the human experience. Call me jaded and naive and unwilling to
    [join the
    crowd](https://www.ft.com/content/dbc0e0c6-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a) and
    profit while the going's good... I suppose Thiel would say it's a mistake to
    retreat to the inner world and stop fighting for greater technological and
    scientific progress. We'll see where my jaded self goes.
    * Jurgenson on [Temporary Social Media](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/temporary-social-media)
      * There's a bit of "let's not get tied down by these permanent records"
      and "let's readd value to social media posts through planned scarcity
      (inteded to play on planned obsolescence)".
  * [Alex Danco](https://medium.com/social-capital/from-pull-and-push-to-here-and-now-the-grand-bargain-of-facebook-and-the-feed-is-unraveling-2bf0538ef3b0) on FB forcing you into one, static
  profile.
* [The Aleph](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgesaleph.pdf) by Jorge Luis
Borges
  * I was not impressed. I got bored. I was expecting something more profound.
  Maybe my mind has become distorted in such a way that I can no longer suspend
  disbelief long enough to appreciate literature.
* [Interface Theory of Perception](http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdf)
  * My notes [here](../13/interface-theory-perception.html).
  * Led me to reread [this awesome
  paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.schres.2017.11.032) on schizophrenia and
  our ability to accurately perceive the timing of "control", or intention over
  our actions. Turns out our back-referral mechanism is a bit overeager and that
  schizophrenics (who have fewer filtering processes) may be right about not
  actually being in control of their actions.
* [Baillie](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/usa/professional-investor/funds/baillie-gifford-international-smaller-companies-fund/) [Gifford](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/uk/individual-investors/insights/ic-article/2018-q4-real-excitement-about-synthetic-biology-all-we-0167?p=12557)
  * It's been a while since I've read material from investing people that doesn't
  sound like total highbrow hogwash. The reason I'm ok with what they wrote here
  is probably because it includes specific examples, especially examples with
  companies that I've never heard of. I suppose you could say my brain is
  craving novelty that doesn't fall into the standard Bay Area categories of
  LessWrong Rationalism and Co; Slate Star Codex; software is eating the world;
  remote work will actually take over the world because COVID-19 made us wake up
  to the reality that working through our computers, not just on them is ok and
  is in fact better for us; what leaving the Bay Area was like for me; what
  moving to the Bay Area was like for me; startup shenanigans and memos; ship
  fast, ship faster, ship fastest. I'm sure I'm missing a couple categories
  of never-ending pollution that fills what ought to be the blue skies of my
  Twitter feed. Please let me know if you have some more categories to add here.
  I am being 50% facetious.
* [Operationalization and Transition to Zero-Sum Dynamics of of Silicon Valley's
   Dearest Software Businesses](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish)
  * Silicon Valley has exhausted the tailwinds of the market pulling for
  information on the Internet. There's too much content, to much to do, and
  already too much time spent on the Internet so the marketplace is shifting
  towards more competitive, zero-sum dynamics. This means a shift from R&D to
  SG&A and focus on building out operationally well-oiled teams of sales and
  marketing. New leaders will be well-versed in taking companies through the
  paces of new-market expansion and fundraising from non-VCs and IPOs rather
  than in building the next major operating system or technology platform. This
  means financial infrastructure like Goldman Sachs for Silicon Valley will
  emerge to help companies through the predictable stages of financial growth
  and take a cut off of the top. You can already see the players of the market
  acknowledging that value is shifting away from software problems to hard
  operational problems. Young people would rather become chief of staff or
  product managers than software engineers.
  * Alex Danco's [Debt Is Coming](https://danco.substack.com/p/debt-is-coming)
  fleshes out the implications of financialization nicely. The main part to
  pay attention to are that fact that recurring revenue from SaaS companies
  looks like fixed income securities. Finance is very, very sophisticated
  about fixed income securities, which means that more investors could get
  interested in securities based on recurring revenue. The other angle is on
  alignment between Carlotta Perez's Financial and Production Capital. Once
  founders and VCs stop playing with fake equity money (and dilution and
  decreased optionality from out of whack valuations) and refocus on putting
  money to work on creating customers and building their businesses, the
  salient, tried and true model of debt-financed growth will emerge. Of course,
  given how deep the connections between founders and VCs (financial capital)
  go in Silicon Valley, with founders often converting to angels viewing
  themselves as capital allocators with bets on the table generally just hanging
  out with the VCs, this conversion will likely not happen in Silicon Valley.
  New York, Tel Aviv, etc will probably jump on debt first.
  * Pair this post with [Scarcity Shifts, by Alex Danco](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/paradigm-shift-machine-part-1-technology-increases-access-to-what-is-scarce-1ed5cbc82537).
  My notes [here](../14/scarcity-shifts-danco.html).
    * Pair the Scarcity post with Alex's other famous series on
    [Scarcity: Emergent Layers](https://medium.com/swlh/emergent-layers-chapter-1-scarcity-abstraction-abundance-5705666e4f15). You can consider this Alex's OG thoughts on scarcity and
    shifts in the value chain. The main addition here is that he ties scarcity
    to the concept of being overserved, which comes from Clayton Christensen's
    theory of Jobs to be Done. A classic example is how Airbnb built a service
    that better served the young people who were being overserved by the hotel
    form of the scarce asset of places stay in interesting destinations.
* [Shared Value Businesses As an Alternative to Ad-Funded
Businesses](https://medium.com/@efeng/who-has-the-best-business-model-and-its-not-google-or-facebook-ca36f967bbd1)
  * Takeaway 1: Ads suck because no one likes watching them and because they
  don't deliver an appropriate distribution of returns across low-value and high
  value customers. The guy who watches 10x more content on Hulu also watches
  10x more ads, but those ads have rapidly decreasing marginal returns, so that
  content lover does not deliver 10x in value.
  * Takeaway 2: Freemium mobile games that run on in-app purchases are a prime
  example of shared value businesses. 2% of the users are high rollers and fund
  the continuation and improvement of the game for the 98% average users. Heavy
  Amazon Prime buyers subsidize the Amazon experience for the less frequent
  users.
  * Takeaway 3: You cannot escape the Pareto curve, so you may as well learn to
  leverage it by ensuring that you can capture monetary value from those 20%
  of high usage customers. Netflix cannot do this because every customer,
  whether they pull all nighters just to finish binge watching their favorite
  show or only use Netflix for their once a month movie night, pays the same
  price. Shared value works as a business model because nobody feels like they
  are getting ripped off. The people who like your product happily pay more
  for it. The people who don't pay the minimum and enjoy their minimum services.
  The passionate bring you enough money for you to keep improving your product,
  which makes everybody happier.
* [Poor, Hungry, and Determined Brought You Hot Cheetos](https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/)
* I read [this article](https://www.billjaneway.com/enterprise-software)
probably five times before I fully incorporated what he was saying about
enterprise software.
* Structureless Organizations

New "Rogue Experts":
* Howard Marks
  * Howard Marks is not new in the sense that I've read his work for years now.
  He is new in that I've been dense enough to not have put him on the rogue
  experts list for years.

Things I Regret Buying
* Coconut flakes from Trader Joe's. Only $1.99, yes, but they don't keep me
satisfied.
* Cheap Colby jack cheese from Safeway. I thought I could get away with a
cheaper price. My tongue has suffered.
* Sliced medium cheddar cheese by Lucerne. The flavor is entirely lacking.
* Goat Cheese. Honestly, I don't enjoy eating it that much. Not sure why I keep
putting myself through this torture.
* Trader Joe's Double Creme Brie. I really don't like the rind. I figured that
out the second time I bought the brie. At this point, I've probably bought
7 or 8 slices of that brie, and suffered every time I eat to the outer edge
and have to eat mostly rind. I prefer the Costco double creme that comes in a
wooden box.

Things I Don't Regret Buying:
* Trader Joe's Feta Cheese. I've bought it twice now. I like to crumble the
cheese into a tupperware and then eat spoonfuls of it with avocados and meat
or just by itself. I need to try their "authentic Greek feta" next time.

Things I Should Have Bought Earlier
* Boursin. I didn't know Trader Joe's sold it!!

Television:
* Still watching [Person of Interest](https://www.netflix.com/title/70197042)
and still loving it. [Update 5/21/2020] Have started falling out of love...
* Stopped watching The Office. Don't see a reason to go back to it.

Movies:
* I tried watching [Rashomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon). Got
bored less than halfway through.

Manga:
* In the middle of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 4: Diamond is Unbreakable. I loved
Steel Ball Run and am so far also very happy with this Adventure.

Random Notes On What's Happened in My Life:
* I had [chillblains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilblains) for the first
time in my life this past winter. I didn't have any symptoms other than
ridiculously itchy and slightly swollen toes. I first thought the itchiness
was due to my getting a mosquito bite while I was sleeping. I washed my sheets
and wiped down my sleeping area with a Clorox wipe. That didn't do anything,
because I'm pretty sure I noticed more little bumps that looked like mosquito
bites appearing on my toes. The itching was typically worst at night, especially
when I tried to warm my feet by keeping them in the covers.
  * Why did this happen? My house only has heating in the living room (honestly
  wtf am I paying rent for) and gets bloody cold in the rooms, which are as far
  from the living room as you can get in this structure. I hate wearing socks
  and felt like I could brave out the cold, as I'd done in nearly every previous
  winter I'd spent in a building with central heating (wtf). Guess my toes
  weren't up to the challenge.
  * The worst part about the chillblains was not knowing what they were for the
  first few days and suffering the itch. I'm pretty sure I found out what they
  were through Reddit.
  * Hopefully I can move into a decent structure when this lease ends and not
  have to suffer the lack of central air control this summer and winter.

New Exercise:
* Weighted Squat Jumps
