Things I forgot to include in the April issue because I'm a dunce (or maybe I
did include them and now just want to reemphasize how intellectual and cool I am
by putting them here):
* [Quantitative Approach to Product Market Fit](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/)
  * [Original](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc)

Books:
* [Sum: 40 tales from the afterlives](https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Tales-Afterlives-David-Eagleman/dp/1491503629)
  * This book was useful for entertainment purposes only.
  * There were a only few sentences I found profound.
* [Siddhartha, by Herman Hesse](https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Novel-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845)
  * Another book for entertainment purposes only.
* Origin of Species

Podcast:
* I actually listened to [Ben's conversation with James on potential errors in
how tech people have been anticipating technological paradigm shifts and the
firms that would appear to take advantage of or build
them](https://stratechery.com/2020/exponent-podcast-the-water-we-swim-in/)
in April, but I forgot to put it on last month's record. They discuss [The End
of the Beginning
article](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/), where Ben lays
out an argument about how firm dominance is established early on in the
development of an industry and how the move from batch processing to continuous
computing is not a paradigm shift. Rather, bach processing and continuous
computing exist on the same spectrum, a spectrum which the dominant firms of
today are best equipped to handle. He's implying that we aren't going to see
any upstart companies uproot Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or Google, just like
there weren't any upstarts to uproot Ford, Chrysler, and GM from the pinnacle of
American automobile manufacturing in the 1920s. This just means that new
startups and the next dominant set of firms will be looking to establish their
roots in a world where computing is taken as a given, rather than as a
destination.
  * They also discuss the idea of path dependent development in the podcast.
    That is, look at how credit cards have developed around the world. America
    got them first, when Bank of America dropped a bunch of them in Fresno in
    1958. Then Europe pulled out chip and PIN credit cards, technology that
    the US largely hasn't adopted. Then China decided, screw you white people
    and your plastic cards; we're going to use smartphones directly. While we
    can argue that the trend is always in the same direction of turning the
    physical cash into digital bits and reducing frictions for people to throw
    their digital bits to the wind, there's no reason to assume the
    instantiation of that trend in any one location will be the same as the
    instantiation of that trend in any other location.
    * I think path dependence is a highly underrated idea and was so happy to
      them have an intelligent conversation about it!

Articles (Only the Worthwhile Ones~):
* I love this interview with Edge.org and Geoffrey West so much that I had to
read it again to soak up the goodness of West's insights into the power laws
that govern the growth of our urban environments. Read
[here](https://www.edge.org/conversation/geoffrey_west-why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-and-people-always-die-and-life-gets).
I wrote notes about the article
[here](../10/geoffrey-west-edge-cities-die.html).
* Peter Thiel's
[The Straussian Moment](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay).
If you like Peter's thinking, you should pair that essay with this [interview he
did with the Hoover Institution on
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8). I wrote notes about the interview [here](../10/thiel-hoover-straussian-moment.html)
* Silicon Valley is growing up....into finance?
  * [Article 1](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish)
  * [Article 2](https://danco.substack.com/p/debt-is-coming)
* [Uruk Machine](https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/)
  * Get ready for a blast on politics and metis (local knowledge) and nihilism
    and some general nonsense writing about modernity. I've added a couple
    links below to help buffer Lou's writing.
  * I'm not sure I understood more than 30 - 40% of the articles. At some point
  I became fed up with Lou's writing and my inability to deeply understand
  what seemed like fundamental points he was making about narcissism and
  paternalism and gri-gri and tuned out. I'm convinced the solution is to dive
  into the books he builds his argument upon and some other philosophers, like
  Nietzche, because there's no way this blog series will compensate for my lack
  of philosophical bedrock.
  * Seeing like a state book review from [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/)
    * Related post from [Scholar's Stage on Tradition being smarter than you](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html)
    * Cargo Cultism
    * [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)
  * This series made me reread Abe Lincoln's [Lyceum Address](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_3/The_Perpetuation_of_Our_Political_Institutions).
    * The main point of the speech is to guide the audience through the thought
    exercise of what happens if citizens take the enforcement of the law into
    their own hands and develop mob law.
    * What stands out most from this Address is Lincoln's acknowledgement that
    playing politics within the sandbox that the Founding Fathers have
    constructed may not be sufficient to satisfy the ambitions of ***. We must
    be wary of people ***.
* [The Aleph](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgesaleph.pdf) by Jorge Luis
Borges
  * I was not impressed. I got bored. I was expecting something more profound.
  Maybe my mind has become distorted in such a way that I can no longer suspend
  disbelief long enough to appreciate literature.
* [Interface Theory of Perception](http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdf)
  * My notes [here](../13/interface-theory-perception.html).
  * Led me to reread [this awesome
  paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.schres.2017.11.032) on schizophrenia and
  our ability to accurately perceive the timing of "control", or intention over
  our actions. Turns out our back-referral mechanism is a bit overeager and that
  schizophrenics (who have fewer filtering processes) may be right about not
  actually being in control of their actions.
* [Baillie](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/usa/professional-investor/funds/baillie-gifford-international-smaller-companies-fund/) [Gifford](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/uk/individual-investors/insights/ic-article/2018-q4-real-excitement-about-synthetic-biology-all-we-0167?p=12557)
  * It's been a while since I've read material from investing people that doesn't
  sound like total highbrow hogwash. The reason I'm ok with what they wrote here
  is probably because it includes specific examples, especially examples with
  companies that I've never heard of. I suppose you could say my brain is
  craving novelty that doesn't fall into the standard Bay Area categories of
  LessWrong Rationalism and Co; Slate Star Codex; software is eating the world;
  remote work will actually take over the world because COVID-19 made us wake up
  to the reality that working through our computers, not just on them is ok and
  is in fact better for us; what leaving the Bay Area was like for me; what
  moving to the Bay Area was like for me; startup shenanigans and memos; ship
  fast, ship faster, ship fastest. I'm sure I'm missing a couple categories
  of never-ending pollution that fills what ought to be the blue skies of my
  Twitter feed. Please let me know if you have some more categories to add here.
  I am being 50% facetious.
* [Operationalization and Transition to Zero-Sum Dynamics of of Silicon Valley's
   Dearest Software Businesses](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish)
  * Silicon Valley has exhausted the tailwinds of the market pulling for
  information on the Internet. There's too much content, to much to do, and
  already too much time spent on the Internet so the marketplace is shifting
  towards more competitive, zero-sum dynamics. This means a shift from R&D to
  SG&A and focus on building out operationally well-oiled teams of sales and
  marketing. New leaders will be well-versed in taking companies through the
  paces of new-market expansion and fundraising from non-VCs and IPOs rather
  than in building the next major operating system or technology platform. This
  means financial infrastructure like Goldman Sachs for Silicon Valley will
  emerge to help companies through the predictable stages of financial growth
  and take a cut off of the top. You can already see the players of the market
  acknowledging that value is shifting away from software problems to hard
  operational problems. Young people would rather become chief of staff or
  product managers than software engineers.
  * Alex Danco's [Debt Is Coming](https://danco.substack.com/p/debt-is-coming)
  fleshes out the implications of financialization nicely. The main part to
  pay attention to are that fact that recurring revenue from SaaS companies
  looks like fixed income securities. Finance is very, very sophisticated
  about fixed income securities, which means that more investors could get
  interested in securities based on recurring revenue. The other angle is on
  alignment between Carlotta Perez's Financial and Production Capital. Once
  founders and VCs stop playing with fake equity money (and dilution and
  decreased optionality from out of whack valuations) and refocus on putting
  money to work on creating customers and building their businesses, the
  salient, tried and true model of debt-financed growth will emerge. Of course,
  given how deep the connections between founders and VCs (financial capital)
  go in Silicon Valley, with founders often converting to angels viewing
  themselves as capital allocators with bets on the table generally just hanging
  out with the VCs, this conversion will likely not happen in Silicon Valley.
  New York, Tel Aviv, etc will probably jump on debt first.
  * Pair this post with [Scarcity Shifts, by Alex Danco](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/paradigm-shift-machine-part-1-technology-increases-access-to-what-is-scarce-1ed5cbc82537).
  My notes [here](../14/scarcity-shifts-danco.html).
    * Pair the Scarcity post with Alex's other famous series on
    [Scarcity: Emergent Layers](https://medium.com/swlh/emergent-layers-chapter-1-scarcity-abstraction-abundance-5705666e4f15). You can consider this Alex's OG thoughts on scarcity and
    shifts in the value chain. The main addition here is that he ties scarcity
    to the concept of being overserved, which comes from Clayton Christensen's
    theory of Jobs to be Done. A classic example is how Airbnb built a service
    that better served the young people who were being overserved by the hotel
    form of the scarce asset of places stay in interesting destinations.
* [Shared Value Businesses As an Alternative to Ad-Funded
Businesses](https://medium.com/@efeng/who-has-the-best-business-model-and-its-not-google-or-facebook-ca36f967bbd1)
  * Takeaway 1: Ads suck because no one likes watching them and because they
  don't deliver an appropriate distribution of returns across low-value and high
  value customers. The guy who watches 10x more content on Hulu also watches
  10x more ads, but those ads have rapidly decreasing marginal returns, so that
  content lover does not deliver 10x in value.
  * Takeaway 2: Freemium mobile games that run on in-app purchases are a prime
  example of shared value businesses. 2% of the users are high rollers and fund
  the continuation and improvement of the game for the 98% average users. Heavy
  Amazon Prime buyers subsidize the Amazon experience for the less frequent
  users.
  * Takeaway 3: You cannot escape the Pareto curve, so you may as well learn to
  leverage it by ensuring that you can capture monetary value from those 20%
  of high usage customers. Netflix cannot do this because every customer,
  whether they pull all nighters just to finish binge watching their favorite
  show or only use Netflix for their once a month movie night, pays the same
  price. Shared value works as a business model because nobody feels like they
  are getting ripped off. The people who like your product happily pay more
  for it. The people who don't pay the minimum and enjoy their minimum services.
  The passionate bring you enough money for you to keep improving your product,
  which makes everybody happier.
* [Poor, Hungry, and Determined Brought You Hot Cheetos](https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/)
* I read [this article](https://www.billjaneway.com/enterprise-software)
probably five times before I fully incorporated what he was saying about
enterprise software.

New "Rogue Experts":
* Howard Marks
  * Howard Marks is not new in the sense that I've read his work for years now.
  He is new in that I've been dense enough to not have put him on the rogue
  experts list for years.

Things I Regret Buying
* Coconut flakes from Trader Joe's. Only $1.99, yes, but they don't keep me
satisfied.
* Cheap Colby jack cheese from Safeway. I thought I could get away with a
cheaper price. My tongue has suffered.
* Sliced medium cheddar cheese by Lucerne. The flavor is entirely lacking.

Things I Should Have Bought Earlier
* Boursin. I didn't know Trader Joe's sold it!!
