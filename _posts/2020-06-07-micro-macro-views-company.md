Macro level:
* Do you care about what the company is working on?
  * Are your skills aligned with the major risks of the company?
* How much money have they raised, from who, and when?
* Who is the CEO and other top leadership / founders?
  * Do you respect them?
* Do you respect the decisions the company has made and the strategy they
currently seem to be executing on?
* Where is the office you will be working at physically located?
* Financial statements
* Things you can find on the company's website.
* Most media about the company

Micro level (I want this list to be as comprehensive as possible):
* Who is your manager?
  * Do you respect him?
* Who are your coworkers?
  * Do you respect them?
  * Do people eat lunch together?
* How much Kool Aid are you expected to drink?
  * How "hard" do people work?
    * Do you think your project will be worth working that hard for?
  * Are people treated as dispensable?
* Do people talk to each other across teams?
* How easy is it to write, test, deploy code?
* Do your coworkers care about their work? Are they generally excited about
what they are building and showing up to work each day?
* What projects will you work on and what exactly do they entail?
* Will I be able to work on stuff that I think is high leverage?
  * Learning new technologies that I think matter or will matter.
  * Building things that can really affect the org's performance.
* Does this team have leverage within the org?
  * How critical is the work this team does?
  * Is the team respected?
    * Is the team overworked or staffed with largely part-time contractors of
    dubious quality?
  * Does the team have decision making power and autonomy?
* What is the power balance between top down directives and bottom up
initiative?
  * What is the power balance between engineering and PM, for example?
* How bureaucratized is the company?
  * This largely correlates with the size of the company. But, if you know the
  company is going through some kind of development milestone like getting ready
  for IPO, you can hone in on the level of bureaucracy that is present or will
  soon be present. You can also look at recent hires to figure out whether there
  is a trend in redistribution of power.
* What is the salary?
* Where is the office physically located?
* What kind of equipment do they give?
  * How easy is it to get the equipment you need to be productive (monitors,
  ergonomic keyboard, standing desk, ergonomic chair, wireless keyboard and
  mouse, etc)?
* What is the office set up like?
  * Open office?
  * Cubicles?
* How good are the benefits?
  * Health care, dental, vision, premiums, deductible, coverage, etc.
  * Time off policies?
  * Remote working policies?
    * Is salary dependent on where you work?
  * Food?

You will never truly know what the micro level is like until you work at the
company, but it probably is more tied to your happiness than the macro level is.

It's easy to do a first pass on whether you will bother applying to a company
based on the macro factors. I ultimately reject employment offers because of
lack of confidence in the quality of the micro level metrics I've listed above.

The lower on the list the micro metrics are, the less they matter, so I'm
unlikely to reject a company because of relatively worse health care benefits.
Frankly, if I'm comparing offers and I'm down to counting pennies on how much
I have to pay for health care, I've probably [gotten
distracted](https://sivers.org/hellyeah) from the more important considerations.

The people micro metrics are high because when it comes down to it, people are
everything (I don't have a great argument for why this is the case...The best
example I can give for why people matter more than what you are doing is that
you could be shoveling horse manure in some sticky, hot as heck tropical country
and still be happy because you've got the right crew working with you.). The
world runs on people. People can block or enable you. They are what you should
have loyalty to (and [what will have loyalty to
you](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/btp3db/lpt_the_purpose_of_hr_is_to_protect_the_company/)).
I've been on enough teams and done enough interviews to have what I'd like to
believe is a pretty good sense for whether the people I'm interviewing with are
worth my energy and skill and lunchtime banter contributions.
