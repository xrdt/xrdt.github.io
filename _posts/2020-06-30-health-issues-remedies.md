Small list of remedies that work for me....and now you know what kinds of health
problems I've had.

* Dizziness
  * Try salt.
* High blood pressure from too much salt?
  * Drink tons of water. You need to lower your blood salinity.
* Excessive tiredness
  * Try salt. If that doesn't work, try an electrolyte mix.

  tastes good and works pretty darn well.
* Chillblains
  * Heat the space or wear socks.
