Click, I believe, used to just be a sound word (onomotapoeia). Now, we've
given click the rights to also be an action ("click the mouse") and a noun
("100 clicks on our Google Ad campaign this morning").

This topic came up because I was thinking about how strange it is that we
say "click the button" when all we're really doing is reinforcing an
association between the "click" sound of the button and the action of, well,
clicking it.

Perhaps there are other words we've augmented in this same way due to the
information age.
