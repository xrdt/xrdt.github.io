Produce results.

Make things happen.

Anyone who believes that the world is automatically going to continuously get better is either ignorant or stupid enough to ignore basic laws of physics and common sense. The Second Law of Thermodynamics clearly predicts that the entropy, or disorderliness, or the universe is constantly increasing. Humans have been able to manage this increasing entropy by innovating and developing technologies that allow us to do more with less. Every major development in human history (including the development of writing, gunpowder, the printing press, factories, genetics, scientific medical treatments, the steam engine, the computer, the Internet, antibiotics) has been accompanied by a great explosion in technology. Every major improvement in the quality of living is a result of better technology, better understanding of the sciences, smarter utilization of resources.

The reason developing countries are moving so quickly is because they are playing catch up with the “developed” world. They can take our knowledge and our resources and replicate our success in their subsets of the world, but once they hit the transition point of independence, will they successfully pivot? China has proven it can. India, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, etc. are working their way towards the stability that defines the US.

But why is this stability desirable? The US has been in a stability spa for the past 40 years. If you read Tyler Cowen’s latest book The Complacent Class, you will come to understand how dangerous our desire, preference, and encouragement of stability is. We are allowing entropy to build up around ourselves. But, those with enough resources have divided the world up into more manageable pieces, so they don’t have to deal with the unpleasantness outside of their backyard.

I’ve come to believe that conflict is good. Change is good. Arguing is good. Discomfort is good. All of these things, for their own sakes, are fundamentally good because they force us to make mistakes. We learn more from mistakes than we do from successes, because we are forced to adapt. A fundamental building block of Darwin’s theory of evolution is that the species which survive were the best at ADAPTING. Those who don’t adapt DIE.

We must never lose the hunger that lies deep in our bellies. We must never settle when we know where is greener grass. Be unhappy. Be dissatisfied. Be angry. Pack up everything and move to a different country, another neighborhood. Never lose sight of your purpose or your drive, because you must work hard to create a better future.
