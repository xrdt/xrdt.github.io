Two amusing things happened to me today:
1. My harmonica was temporarily held by security at La Sagrada Familia.
Apparently visitors are not allowed to bring instruments into the temple. Our
tour guide was surprisingly upset about the incident. Perhaps he was trying
to appear more upset and "on our side" so we would think of him as a
more responsible guide.

2. A hotel attendant came into my room to "replace the plant in my bathroom".
Here's a picture of the plant:
