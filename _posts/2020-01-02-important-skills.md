1. [Debugging](https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/) (from code to your life). Systemic problem solving.
2. Who to have loyalty to
3. [What to do you with your life](http://www.windsweptsoftware.net/rickoverthoughts.pdf) and how to figure it out
4. How to keep yourself spiritually, physically, and mentally sharp (nutrition, anyone?)
5. Courage / willpower / integrity / commitment
6. Firing / [Hiring people](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) (Hire people that get things done)
7. All it takes to do BHA (big hairy audacious things) is willpower and curiosity. The rest is luck.
8. Negotiation. How to think like a gangster.
9. That you should follow your nose because every great journey begins with curiosity (wonder is also a good synonym).
