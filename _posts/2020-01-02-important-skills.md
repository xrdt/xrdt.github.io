1. [Debugging](https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/) (from code to your life).
Systemic problem solving.
2. The world runs on people. It runs on people talking to each other, getting
to know each other over coffee or meals, building loyalty to each other,
stabbing each other in the back, being upset at each other, so on and so forth.
People skills are so important because, in the end, everything is about people.
  * People can make or break an experience.
  * How to figure out who to have loyalty to.
  * If people start moving the goalposts on you or applying double standards or
  overall just not being straight with you, you should go right ahead and cut
  them out of your life. Ain't nobody got time to deal with that two faced
  backstabbing unreliable nonsense.
3. [What to do with your life](http://www.windsweptsoftware.net/rickoverthoughts.pdf)
and how to figure it out.
  * You should spend your time in unforgiving arenas like science and sports so
  you can develop a sharply tuned, objective sense for correctness without the
  need for official (expert fucking "opinion") intermediation.
4. How to keep yourself spiritually, physically, and mentally sharp (nutrition,
fitness).
5. Courage (when to stand up for things) / willpower (getting things done is a
matter of someone being hardheaded enough to push through the walls that will
appear to stop them from getting things done) / integrity (doing the right
thing on principle) / commitment / responsibility.
6. Firing / [Hiring people](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) (Hire people
that get things done).
  * [Managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one).
7. All it takes to do BHA (big hairy audacious things) is willpower and
curiosity ( and optimism, but curiosity implies that ). The rest is luck.
 * Everything gets done because one person was antsy enough and had enough
balls to push through all the barriers to get something done.
8. Negotiation. How to think like a gangster.
9. That you should follow your nose because every great journey begins with
curiosity (wonder is also a good synonym).
10. Organization. How to organize and manage your life (prioritization, focus, discipline).
 * Personal Knowledge Repository. How do you manage all the information that you
 consume and think is important.
 * Write just about every f\*\*\*ing thing down.
11. Analyzing path dependence. [Ben Thompson recorded a great podcast with
James Allworth that covers this topic](https://stratechery.com/2020/exponent-podcast-the-water-we-swim-in/).
12. You can't convince people to do things. They have to convince themselves.
You can put the stepping stones in front of people to guide them through the
logic that should get them to a destination where agree with you, but their
acceptance of that destination is a switch you can't directly flip.
 * Yeah, sociopaths and people who are highly successful at manipulating
 others exists. Perhaps that points more to most people's lack of spine and
 rather absurd belief that [people are generally good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8&t=1m55s)
 as well as evidence in the effectiveness of these people's ability to
 manipulate others.
 * Since I live in a world where nearly all anybody can think about is VCs and
 startups and getting rich in this highly risky and levered way of owning
 potential unicorn equity, this thought mostly comes from thinking about
 potential founder-founder/founder-employee interactions. You can "convince"
 someone that working on your startup is worth their time and energy, but when
 things get tough, you'll know whether they've actually accepted your proposal.
 * This also means that when you present opportunities to people (or "sell"), at
 some point there is nothing you can do to push them over the edge. They have to
 rock back and forth on that knife's edge of "do I accept this or not" until
 they are ok with the consequences of their decision.
13. "You get rich by delivering to the world what it wants at scale." -- Naval.
 * Lower and middle class people think they can get rich by working hard.
That's equivalent to believing that you can get rich by playing with scaling up
a linear function of your inputs to your outputs. The most linear function of
your inputs to your outputs in this world is your salary. The more hours you put
in, the more you get paid. There's a limit to how much money you can make by
moving up the ladder, too. It's not an exponential scale, even if you start from
a high base (high base careers include HFT, medicine, software eng).
 * Rich people realize that they got rich by finding superlinear or even
exponential functions to transform their inputs. A classic example is land rent.
Land ownership requires relatively negligible effort to maintain and collect
money from. Another example is equity. A more recent example is the Internet.
Whenever you see things that have massive economies of scale or that somehow
get more efficient the bigger they get, you know you're looking at an
opportunity to leverage your inputs into something much larger than you can
intuitively understand (humans have a hard time understanding exponential
growth).
