1. [Debugging](https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/) (from code to your life).
Systemic problem solving.
2. How to figure out who to have loyalty to.
3. [What to do you with your life](http://www.windsweptsoftware.net/rickoverthoughts.pdf)
and how to figure it out
4. How to keep yourself spiritually, physically, and mentally sharp (nutrition,
fitness, anyone?)
5. Courage (when to stand up for things) / willpower (getting things done is a
matter of someone being hardheaded enough to push through walls) / integrity
(do the right thing) / commitment / responsibility
6. Firing / [Hiring people](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) (Hire people
that get things done)
7. All it takes to do BHA (big hairy audacious things) is willpower and
curiosity. The rest is luck.
8. Negotiation. How to think like a gangster.
9. That you should follow your nose because every great journey begins with
curiosity (wonder is also a good synonym).
10. Organization. How to organize and manage your life (prioritization, focus, discipline).
 * Personal Knowledge Repository. How do you manage all the information that you
 consume and think is important.
11. Analyzing path dependence. [Ben Thompson recorded a great podcast with
James Allworth that covers this topic](https://stratechery.com/2020/exponent-podcast-the-water-we-swim-in/).
12. You can't convince people to do things. They have to convince themselves.
You can put the stepping stones in front of people to guide them through the
logic that should get them to a destination where agree with you, but their
acceptance of that destination is a switch you can't directly flip.
 * Yeah, sociopaths and people who are highly successful at manipulating
 others exists. Perhaps that points more to most people's lack of spine and
 rather absurd belief that [people are generally good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8&t=1m55s)
 as well as evidence in the effectiveness of these people's ability to
 manipulate others.
 * Since I live in a world where nearly all anybody can think about is VCs and
 startups and getting rich in this highly risky and levered way of owning
 potential unicorn equity, this thought mostly comes from thinking about
 potential founder-founder/founder-employee interactions. You can "convince"
 someone that working on your startup is worth their time and energy, but when
 things get tough, you'll know whether they've actually accepted your proposal.
 * This also means that when you present opportunities to people (or "sell"), at
 some point there is nothing you can do to push them over the edge. They have to
 rock back and forth on that knife's edge of "do I accept this or not" until
 they are ok with the consequences of their decision.
