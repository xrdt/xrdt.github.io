Frequently people phrase their desires as if-then statements. For example,
they'll say "If I have enough money, then I'll buy a nice house in Beverly
Hills". I recommend that you start using "when". For example, "When I
get enough money, I'll buy a nice house in Beverly Hills". Prime your mind to
get you closer to your goals, rather than leaving your goals as some distant
possibility.
