This is copied directly out of emails I shared with
[Brian Timar](https://www.briantimar.com).

The book is written as a dialogue between Girard and
[Jean-Michel Oughourlian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Oughourlian)
and Guy Lefort. I often felt like I was sitting in on a conversation without
enough context. Much of my time was spent slowly rereading sentences and
looking up, for the 10th time, what ethnology and ethology and structuralism
were. I don't understand structuralism at all, but I'm confident I'll fix it
when I go back for another pass through this first part and finish the rest
of the book.

The book started by discussing the conflict that can emerge from mimesis and
how primitive societies try to prevent these conflicts with prohibitions on
things like twins or mirrors or repeating another person’s words or gestures.
Some of these prohibitions (of which Girard does not give many, but you could
imagine the institution of monogamy and basic property rights as other
examples), like the mirrors or twins, seem absurd, but they show how little
the primitive societies understand the underlying mechanism and thus how much
sway this mysterious phenomenon of mimetic conflict held over them.

As usual, these prohibitions eventually break down. People get into such
heated mimetic conflict that they threaten to tear apart the community. The
solution that emerges is ritual. These rituals tend to be brutal, ending in
sacrifice of human or animal. You can think of Aztec sacrifice as a
particularly graphic example. The point of the ritual is to find a scapegoat
(original meaning is the Biblical one) that can take on the burdens of the
conflict and, through death, bring back peace. One important thing to note
here is that this figure starts out as anonymous and becomes a definite
entity that the community can rally against through the ritual. You can start
to see some of why such a sacrifice figure becomes a sacred or worshipped
figure by noting that this figure brings death and conflict in life but life
and peace in death. They defy ordinary human “laws”. Because primitive
societies have no idea why this mechanism works, they try to recreate the
scenario every time something bad happens, like when a flood or famine or
fire or war breaks out.

A big sacred sacrificial figure is Jesus. You could say Jesus is important
because he is the “final” sacrifice. His sacrifice should end all sins and
conflict, thus ending humans’ cyclical lifestyle and worldview. Without
cyclicality, we can conceive of and pursue linear progress: tomorrow is
better than today is better than yesterday.
[David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/peter-thiel) has a nice piece on
Thiel and Girard and progress. Girard hasn’t yet discussed the Jesus idea
yet, but I’m pretty sure he will come back to it as a prominent case study.

All these ideas seem pretty crazy, but Girard’s argument for why is that we
have started to understand how this mechanism works. As a result, it has less
of an effect on us. As a result, we have no strong modern analogies for
understanding how this phenomenon could produce sophisticated human cultures
and thus disbelieve that we can reduce religion and ritual and prohibition
into the single idea of mimesis. Even Girard admits that this first chapter
of exposition is insufficient, as good as phlogiston was as an explanation of
combustion, and that the rest of the book should illuminate the details.

The second chapter is about tracing how power, in the form of kingship and
monarchy, can emerge from the delaying of ritual sacrifice. The basic idea is
that the victim becomes sacred upon conclusion of the ritual and that any
subsequent incarnations of him must inherit some of this respect. Thus, if
you can legitimately convince people that you, as the victim, deserve respect,
you will extend the time until your sacrifice and accumulate legitimate power.
