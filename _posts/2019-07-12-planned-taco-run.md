Last year was [midnight donuts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WgXglqZSxiG9nV0EaK7tRTgd0on3YZdp&usp=sharing).
This year, learning from from how the
previous year's experience on how saturating sugar can be, was
supposed to be a
[taco run](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iEK_i-blelnZ5_TY6x35YNIgIGIulML4&usp=sharing).
What went wrong?

What went wrong was that I underestimated my ability to quickly
metabolise omakase....no, that's not the right way to say it...I was
stupid and ate a big meal before the tacos run.

I went with two of the taco run adventurers for omakase at Sushi
[Kimagure Ike](https://www.visitpasadena.com/businesses/sushi-kimagure-ike/) in Pasadena, near the gold line station.
All three of us got the Hana option, which was a delightful mixture of
fish and soy sauce and rice (is this facetious enough?). No, really,
for $90, the food is delightful. All I will say is that after one
night of sushi, my appetite for the Japanese delicacy is sated for
a month.

The owner of the store is very nice and likes to play jokes on his
customers. The store is small, so you may find it nice to place a
reservation. Do try to sit at the bar. That's where you get the most
experience out of being a sushi restaurant.

One of the taco run sushi attendees was freaking out about
the US's new requirement for
[social media information from visa applicants](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48486672). Privacy is the new commodity. I read
a brilliant article recently about the environment and how we work
so hard to get back things we destroyed and how privacy is now in the
same category of depravity as the environment...cannot find it. Would
greatly appreciate if someone found it and sent the link to me...on
a blog with a fish as the logo?

Anyway, the taco run was abridged and we just went to
[Plancha Tacos](http://www.planchatacos.com) in Venice. We chose this
location because three of the five taco run attendees thought Plancha
Tacos had the world's best taco, in the form of their tiger shrimp
taco ($4?). I've had this taco before, and while it is pretty tasty,
I don't think I can say that tacos are all that spectacular. Don't get
me wrong, I like tacos. I will go out of my way to find taco joints.
But taco will never be a gourmet food. They're always too dry, too
flavorless, too full of hard meat, too this too that to really be
the pinnacle of what I've put on my palette.
