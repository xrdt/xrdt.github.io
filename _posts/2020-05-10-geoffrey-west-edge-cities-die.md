[Here's the link](https://www.edge.org/conversation/geoffrey_west-why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-and-people-always-die-and-life-gets)
to this brilliant interview that I happened upon years ago and have come back
to every year because the insights he discusses are just that sticky.

First insight: Metabolic rate scales with size with an exponent of 3/4.

Why is that crazy? Well, we assume natural selection evolves based on history
and environmental niches, not based on some underlying template. The other crazy
thing is that this phenomena manifests across 30 orders of magnitude, from cells
to ecosystems.

Second insight: All physiological variables, from oxygen diffusion across
alveoli to length of aorta to lifespan (I assume measured against size) scale
according to a power law with an exponent that is a multiple of 1/4.

Third insight: The fact that the exponent is less than 1 means that there are
economies of scale. It also means life moves slower for bigger organisms.
Elephants, whales, turtles, all live longer because the rate of decay is
inherently slower.

Consider scaling an organism by 10^4 (10,000). Naively, you expect that organism
requires 10^4 as much energy. With a power law that has a 3/4 exponent, you only
need 10^3, or 1,000 times more energy. Huge energy savings!!! (I wonder if it
qualifies for EnergyStar.)

How does biology achieve these economies of scale? It builds hierarchical
networks. Consider the reduction in size from arteries to arterioles to
capillaries. What are the basic principles governing these hierarchical
networks? First, the networks are space filling. Next, there are invariant
building units. Cells don't change drastically from humans to whales.

Where does the 4 in the denominator come from? It's actually 3 + 1. 3 spatial
dimensions and one. The extra dimension is from the fractal nature of these
networks.

Now the vector of curiosity points towards cities and social structures. Do
cities follow similar power laws as biology? What about companies?

City insights (measured against population):
* All infrastructure scales with the same .85 exponential. Gas stations, miles
of road, electrical lines, etc. Consistent across countries.
* 1.15 exponential for socioeconomic factors, meaning there are returns to scale
for things like wages or patents or cultural events AND disease, crime, and
pollution.
* The scaling of pace is the reverse of biology. Life speeds up in cities.
Walking speed is one example.
* A superlinear exponential cannot continue forever. There is no perpetual
motion machine. There are not infinite resources. But we have managed to stave
off extinction with continuous cycles of innovation. Bronze, iron, coal, IT.
* Theorem: Continuous open growth requires continuous cycles of innovation, with
each cycle shorter than the last.
  * Effectively, you have to innovate faster and faster to keep collapse at bay.
* These results are consistent across countries.
* West believes these scaling laws are a macro manifestation of how individual
humans interact and form clusters of interaction. Humans all around the world
can only main 5 - 6 serious connections. 3 - 4 of those connections are probably
already taken up by family. Other connections to friends and coworkers and your
boss and the CEO of your company weaken in a hierarchical fashion.

Does this same insight about human interaction in cities apply to companies?

Company insights against number of employees:
* Sales, profits, taxation, assets, etc. *most* scale sublinearly! Like biology!
There is more variation in this data than for biological or city data. This
means companies are dominated more by economies of scale than by wealth
reation. (Coase nature of the firm.)
  * Sublinear growth means an eventually stopping point to the growth and ...
  death (death could be a merger).
  * Growth follows a sigmoid curve, meaning there is a ramp up to a period of
  fast growth then asymptotic growth to the point of death.
  * Sales increase linearly. Profits increase with exponent 1/8. Eventually,
  the profit to sales margin goes to zero!
  * West speculates that one reason why companies die is that there is
  increasing fluctuations in quantities like sales, profits, taxation, etc as
  the company size increases. It is the fluctuation that eventually pushes a
  company out of its element.

Final piece of speculation: you can't run a company without the administrative
aspects dominating the company and driving out the eccentricity and diversity
that make cities dynamic. Who knows why cities aren't destroyed by the
administrative?
