* [Optimize Paul Saladino's Carnivore Diet](https://optimisingnutrition.com/optimising-paul-saladino-mds-nose-to-tail-carnivore-diet/)
  * [Paul Saladino](https://carnivoremd.com) is a voice of reason in the modern
  Twitter and podcast hosted debates on optimal nutrition. He's a big advocate
  for nose to tail carnivore and has successfully stuck to a no plant diet for
  about two years now. This post does an excellent job of breaking down Paul's
  micronutrient intake, explaining the relationship between calorie intake
  and intake of certain nutrients, and giving clear suggestions for how to
  improve intake of certain vitamins and minerals that Paul seems to be missing.
  Nutrition is the most interesting and fundamental field related to
  biochemistry and I'm so sad that schools don't include first principles,
  research paper based nutritional courses as a required part of the curriculum.
  Garbage in; garbage out, friends.

* [Bill Gurley on What Characterizes Strong Revenue
Streams (2011)](http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/05/24/all-revenue-is-not-created-equal-the-keys-to-the-10x-revenue-club/?ck_subscriber_id=547821799)
  * People like Price / Revenue ratios and DCF but not all revenues are the same
  and DCF is notoriously difficult to get right. There is huge disparity in P/R
  ratios, from 0.2x for Overstock to 21.7x for YouKu (2011). What figures?
    * Moat. Durability of competitive advantage.
    * Network effects. What is the decay function for the marginal contribution
    of each new user to the platform? Know the difference between returns to
    scale and network effects.
    * Predictability of revenues. Subscription vs. one time.
    * Switching costs and customer lock in. Talk to me about that churn.
    * Gross margins.
    * Marginal profitability: change in revenue / change in costs. Is this
    number improving?
    * Customer concentration. Diversity in customer base.
    * Partner dependencies.
    * Organic demand vs marketing spend.
    * Growth. Watch for companies substituting revenue growth for profits
    (selling dollars for cents) or riding a trend that has little to no
    barriers to entry.
    * Capital expenditure intensity.
    * Optionality (AWS opening up revenue streams for Amazon).
    * Cash flow / earnings. Cash is king.
  *  [The New Increasing Returns Paradigm of Firm and Product Maturation
  (1996)](https://hbr.org/1996/07/increasing-returns-and-the-new-world-of-business)
    * The old economic paradigm has been dominated by an assumption that world
    operates on diminishing returns. A (stagnating?) equilibrium will eventually
    be reached. This is a view of the world that fits the standard company of
    the Industrial Revolution: bulk-manufacturer whose growth is limited by
    access to resources.
      * The priority for these bulk processing companies is to make sure there
      is no break in the supply chain. Their bread and butter is control and
      planning and optimization of those functions. Hierarchical structures
      dominate.
    * Knowledge based industries tend to be governed by increasing returns
    and positive feedback loops.
      * Think winner take all markets. Rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
      Ecosystem lock-in. Fat profits for the winner. Inferior
      product that gets the market to tilt in its favor may win.
      * Management here is constantly focused on looking for the next big
      winner. They're always looking around the casino, trying to decide which
      tables they want to gamble it. Hierarchies flatten because the next big
      thing can come from anyone in the org. It's not a management game for the
      faint hearted. Adaptation and nimbleness must be your main competitive
      strengths.
      * How do you win in this game?
        * Heavily discount initially to acquire users.
        * Build a 2-3x(sic) better product.
        * Build an (cross-company) ecosystem with network effects.
        * Play the psychology of convincing others that a market is already
        locked in to prevent others from attempting to compete.
      * When locality doesn't matter, winner takes all will dominate.
      * When locality does matter, smaller local players will tie into a central
      network, like law firms tied to Lexis-Nexis or doctors tied to HMOs.
    * Why is high tech dominated by increasing returns:
      * Up front costs and decreasing marginal costs.
      * Network effects.
      * Customer lock in.
    * Play the increasing returns game well:
      * Watch the feedback loops
      * Watch the ecologies you play in
      * Do you have the resources needed to make the right sized bets?
      * What's on the horizon?
    > As the economy shifts steadily away from the brute force of things into
    the powers of mind, from resource-based bulk processing into knowledge-based
    design and reproduction, so it is shifting from a base of diminishing
    returns to one of increasing returns.

  * "Universalize as if the process you use to universalize would itself become universal."
  * "But there’s a risk that postmodernism collapses into ppl ignoring any facts
  they disagree with, arguing that facts are mutable products of hostile power
  structures trying to perpetuate themselves. And by 'there’s a risk', I mean
  'this has been obviously happening for decades'.
  * "Postmodernism says that facts often get reframed to support the powerful.
  So it’s inevitable that post-modernism itself going to be twisted to support
  the powerful. (e.g. both cultural Marxists, & far-right media)."

  * Basically only need 10 - 20% to be infected with COV-19 to get herd immunity
  b/c people have t-cell immunity from previous infections. Thus, any sheltering
  in place and mask wearing and otherwise infection slowing activities are just
  prolonging our adaptation to the virus and setting the right conditions for
  companies like Moderna to make bank on a vaccine.
* [Fat vs Carb Oxidation and Storage in Active Individuals](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1139/h99-030)
  * Carb and protein preferentially oxidized. Fat initially shunted into adipose
  tissue. After about 4 days of high CHO diet, fat starts to be oxidized.
  Glycogen depleting exercise improves fat oxidation. Takes about 7 days to
  become fat adapted (fat burning). Sedentary people should therefore control
  their carbohydrate intakes because they can quickly oversupply their body's
  ability to store energy in muscle or liver glycogen or even in adipose tissue.
* [Carb Intolerance and Lipemia](https://sci-hub.tw/10.7326/0003-4819-68-4-926)
  * No connection between carb intolerance (diabetes) and lipemia (fatty acids
  in blood). Pretty much everybody has blood triglycerides go up 50-100%
  overnight after eating high CHO diet. Obesity is an aggravating factor in
  endogenous lipemia. Cellular adiposity leads to relative insulin insensitivity.
  Hyperinsulism is directly related to obesity and is also related to endogenous
  lipemia so obesity just makes the condition worse. Weight reduction again
  helps massively with the elevated serum triglyceride levels.
  Respect your insulin hormone!!!
* [Carb vs Fat Induced Lipemia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9706857_Carbohydrate-induced_and_fat-induced_lipemia)
  * Main focus on carb induced. Patients with fat induced, which is super rare,
  was due to severely lacking lipase enzyme activity (likely genetic). Not clear
  why carb induced happens but it was confirmed that the triglycerides in the
  serum were from lipogenesis from dietary CHO. For people with carb induced,
  lowest triglycerides achieved on high fat diets. Caloric insufficiency can
  also lower serum triglyceride levels. Very good research paper overall on
  how the body controls serum triglyceride levels.
