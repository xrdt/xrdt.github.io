  * Met the guy who [built this](https://denread.com/) on Lunchclub the other
  day. He's now thinking about building a similar, nearest neighbor paragraph
  search tool. Below are some other cool tools that he introduced me to.
    * [AI powered scientific search engine](https://www.resolute.ai/how-it-works)
    * ["Automated" Information Extraction from Arbitrary
   Documents](https://www.infrrd.ai/). I put quotes because apparently a lot of
   the work is manual labor.
    * [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts). Good old keyword based
    web monitoring. It will probably take some time to get the keyword search
    to have the right recall and precision, but it seems like a nice way to
    escape the black holes that explicitly algorithmic suggestion feeds
    inevitably turn into.
