What follows is a list of ideas I'd like to keep floating around, so I can pick them up at the right time:
* Water recycling shower
* Better Bookmarking App
  * Personal knowledge management system
  * Should be structured as a graph with an easy way to explore links between
  nodes of information.
* RSS Reader (like Reeder)
* App Like Blackberry Hub
* Learn about pointclouds (LiDAR and robotic navigation)
* Simulation game like Everything (Alan Watts)
* Cute weather information by text every morning
* A programmatic way to make flashcards. E.g. "Make flash cards out of the first 1000 Russian numbers‚Äù
* Budgeting, personal finance app
* Flight visualization tool
* Suburbia posts Devon (but I think she finished it??)
* Blender
* PiHole in the house
