At some point during this whole coronavirus nonsense, I decided that my future
living strategy would be to establish a home base somewhere I would be happy to
live nine months of the year and then spend the remaining 3+ months doing
extended, one-month stays in other cities. This is an adjustment from my previous
belief that the best way to take advantage of my currently relatively unburdened
by relationships state would be to work in as many different cities as possible.
These work contracts should be a minimum of 6 months long. Most of the cities
I wanted to live in were big or hip American / Canadian cities, like New York
and Chicago and Dallas and Denver.

I think my newfound reluctance to move is partly due to the travel restrictions
imposed by corona. It's that much more mentally taxing to think about travel and
taking care of myself while away from my homebase, especially since the cities
I listed are all large metropolitan centers. Another part of my newfound
reluctance to move is my realization that I don't really want to leave where I'm
living right now. I'm frankly very anchored to California and neither want to
leave my budding social connections nor the always temperate (but growing
warmer) weather. Of course, none of these reasons are really objective. They're
just points of lower cost on some multidimensional preference curve that I've
pulled out because of how securely placed those reasons are in the current
Overton curve and because of how much of Schelling points those reasons are.

I've only made three moves in my life: once between adjacent cities when I was
young, once to college, and once for my first full time job. Based on this new
guideline, my next move should be within the confines of the Bay Area. But maybe
I will gain the courage (to just break free of what I know and blaze a new path
for myself) or find some other compelling reason (would I contemplate moving out
of state or even out of the country for a job?) to leave this comfortable
valley of the California that I've grown up and ventured into adulthood in.
As much as I often refuse to believe it, the future is mine to craft. Let's hope
I actually do craft it.
