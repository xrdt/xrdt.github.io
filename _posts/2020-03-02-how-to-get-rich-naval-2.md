Listen to or read the podcast [here](https://nav.al/rich).

We're back with [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval) and [Nivi](https://twitter.com/nivi) for another hour
of the "How to Get Rich" mega podcast.

We left off last time on the discussion about how to build specific knowledge. Scott Adams was brought up
as the quintessential example of someone with *tons* of specific knowledge.

__On Becoming A Really Standout Person (Building Specific Knowledge)__:<br>
Nivi: Scott Adams has an idea about becoming [75th percentile at two+ different
things](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html) so you are the only
person in the world that has that combination of skills.

NavaL: I think the way to build specific knowledge is to follow your own obsession. You need to pick something
you love so you will go deep enough to achieve the level of mastery, individual "luck" (ref 4th kind of luck
[here](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html) that defines specific knowledge. If you take
Scott Adams approach, you've combinatorially expanded the number of valuable things you could be exceptional
at. If there are 10,000 skills society values, and you take 10,000 choose 3 of them, you've now got well
over a billion combinations on top of which to build wealth. Now it's much less competitive and much easier [easier
to hit](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) the target level of mastery in each of the skills you're intending to combine.
The caveat here is to *not* become too enamored with deliberate choice of the skills. You should try to leverage
your *natural* skills.

I don't think Scott Adams' and Naval's points are different. I think Naval just gets caught up in his obsession with
creativity and passion and going where you mind takes you. He call Scott Adams' advice "pragmatic" and tries to make
it seem like it's stiff and rigid and engineered in some way that will guarantee you a boring, unfulfilling sort
of success (sorry, did I get caught up and take this took far?). Anyway, I think Scott Adams' point is the base and
Naval's love for creativity is an embellishment.

__Building and Selling__<br>:
A company needs both a builder and a seller.

So we don't get bogged down into what a builder is and what a seller is, let me list out a couple of common job titles
each persona can take on.

Builder:
* Software engineer
* Hardware engineer
* Designer
* Procurement
* Supply chain manager
* Logistics manager
* CTO

Seller:
* Marketing
* Communications
* Public Relations
* Recruiting
* Fundraising
* CEO

It is rare to see both the builder and seller combined in a single person, and sometimes the division isn't quite so clear,
but it's a trope to look out for (just like the [Seven Basic
Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots#The_Rule_of_Three)). This idea has become so common that practically
all VCs look for strength in both these areas on the founding team.

One contemporary person who has both building and selling skills is Elon Musk. He understands the technical requirements and challenges
and knows how to deliver these messages to a wider audience, especially to people who he wants to form alliances with.

Can you develop selling skills or building skills later in life? It's a common quip that it's harder to teach the technical skills of building
to a seller than the than the softer skills of selling to a builder. Naval agrees with this and says that building is hard to teach because
it requires so much focused effort to do right. One way to think about building and selling is that building is more useful in the early days.
It's what gets you going, what gets peoples' attention, what gets you your reputation. Building is what helps you stand out amongst all the
hustlers and high energy people with nothing else to back themselves up with. Selling is better once you have a reputation established.
Selling scales better because now your reputation as someone who's good to do business with starts pulling deals with more leverage.
Leverage in [building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law) can never be that high because it fundamentally is a very time consuming,
brain consuming, energy consuming activity.

__Continuous Learning, or Becoming an Autodidact__:<br>
Reading is the foundation of learning. It is important to learn to educate yourself because only *you* can figure out what's important in your life.
It's up to you to craft your own destiny by building something that the world wants and deploying it at scale. Your ability to build something
unique and valuable depends on your ability to see something interesting, which depends on your ability to form connections between what you know and
what you perceive as reality. The bigger a base off which you can make connections to reality, the bigger an advantage you will have in knowing what
to build and how to build it.

Reading > listening. Doing > watching.

But at some point, you run out of time to do everything and have to optimize what you read and *how* you read(see #10 bullet 1 in
[this](../../01/02/important-skills.html)).

If you are struggling to make reading a habit, read what you love until you love what you read. Eventually your tastes will change to accommodate
the increase in your skills and you will naturally move towards more difficult, more abstract, more theoretical, more foundational texts.
Ref [my post on teaching](../../../2018/11/02/teachers-role.html).

A few categories which Naval would recommend you to learn about. Links are mine:
* game theory
* microeconomics
* psychology (esp. psychology of [pers](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X)[uasion](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Curious-Science-Creating-Business/dp/006238841X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=rory+alchemy&qid=1583041021&s=books&sr=1-1)
* ethics
* [mathematics](https://www.neilwithdata.com/mathematics-self-learner)
* [computers](https://teachyourselfcs.com)

In order to set yourself up for reading success, you should read the original, foundational texts. Here's a couple of examples:
* Economics -- Adam Smith's [Wealth of Nations](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm)
* Evolutions -- Darwin's [Origin of Species](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1228/1228-h/1228-h.htm)
* Biotech -- Judson's [Eighth Day of Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Eighth-Day-Creation-Revolution-Commemorative/dp/0879694785)
* Cosmology -- Feynman's [Six Easy Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Easy-Pieces-Essentials-Explained/dp/0465025277)

You want to get to the point where you can pick up any book in the library and understand it and reject what is false and accept
what is true. Getting to that point requires you to have a solid foundation in the fundamentals, which often means mathematics
and physics because those are what science is built upon. You need to learn the fundamentals because they are the basic algorithms and
principles on which the world is built. They'll also help you filter out the bullshit from
[the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)
([It's easier to macro-bullshit than micro-bullshit](https://twitter.com/TalebBot/status/612155807053037568)).

Don't be afraid to toss books out the window in a fit when you get bored with them. There's not enough time in the world for you to be fretting over
some nonsense that you're not sure has real truth value. Besides, you can always come back to books (just write them down somewhere in that
nice [personal](https://evernote.com) [knowledge](https://www.notion.so) [repository](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) I know you've so hard
at work curating).

Don't be afraid to spend a lot of time on an amazing book. The best books take time to soak in, and you may have to spend a lot of time, doing
something you may feel like is a waste of time in the process (ref
[Thumbtack](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-kickstart-and-scale-a-marketplace-2e5) in this post). But don't worry, because obsessiveness probably
has a higher likelihood of working out than does non-obsessive flitting around like a bored playboy.

Now is probably a good time for your to sign up for a library card and put a bunch of cool books on hold. Like eBooks? Look no further than
[Standard eBooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/), which I think does mostly fiction, and [Library Genesis](http://libgen.is).

One of the biggest blockers to you taking control of your education is your curiosity (I put that on my [homepage](../../../index.html) for a reason.)
Curiosity is the spark for you going out and conquering the sources of uncertainty in your life. Try to cultivate it and break free of the compliance
culture that your [schooling](https://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Anniversary/dp/0865714487) probably indoctrinated in you.

Nivi: I think you need to learn practical persuasion and deep in some technical category to lay a foundation for learning.
Naval: The five most important skills are reading, writing, arithmetic, persuasion, programming (leverage on basic arithmetic).

__Business: the Non-Skill__:<br>
Naval: Business is the bottom of the barrel of knowledge. There is no skill called business.

A lot of the value from business school comes from case studies, or anecdotes. This is because there's a limit to what we can explicitly teach and what
we have to rely on some intrinsic pattern matching to get across. The issue is that even if you build up some abstract mental models (I hear they're all
the rage these days...thanks [Munger](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=poor+charlie%27s+alamnack) and [Farnam Street](https://www.fs.blog)), you won't *really*
know how to use them until you're in that situation (at which point your grasp on those models probably to the point of uselessness and forgetting). Tools
from mathematics and game theory and hard sciences will probably serve you better in the long run. I have a disdain for consultants and MBA types because they
sit around playing house with other people's businesses but don't seem to actually understand what it takes to sit in the
[hot seat and deliver](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22418554). (I got burned by Mr Pearson of the McKinsey firm during the
[Valeant scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Valeant_Pharmaceuticals_International), so I sometimes pretend that's a reason why I don't
think consultants are worth their salt..) It's not entirely clear to me that consultants have skin the game or see deeply into the business. And perhaps those are all

Iterations are what drive your learning curve. You learn through repeated experimentation. Getting more iterations *does* lead to more hours put in, but doing the
same thing a million times isn't as good as refining your technique each time you step up to bat. Learning only happens when you incorporate new information.

We aren't designed to be ok with losing a little bit and then making a big payday, but that's what it takes to learn something new. Let me refine that statement.
Doing something new by definition comes with a high chance of failure. If you can contain the magnitude of that failure, you'll be able to get lots of at bats and
probably survive to hit a home run. Maybe baseball isn't the best analogy...the idea is that you want to be able to tolerate lots of small failures while you work
up to the big payday. This is how [Nassim Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) made his riches as a trader and
what entrepreneurs battle through every single day. Entrepreneurs take on a daily risk of not making money, of not eating or sleeping or drinking, of losing face
in front of everyone who invested in them, but when they win, they win big. So on average, entrepreneurs make more.

It's no trivial task to be willing to "bleed a little every day", as Naval said. People like the steady salary, the slow but reliable hit. In exchange for consistency,
they'll take on the risk of going completely bankrupt. You'll tolerate the tedium of your government job knowing that 999999.999999 days out of 1000000 you'll wake up and
be able to take the 45 minute commute along the local highway to your cubicle in your white collar shirt but that .000001 days out of 1000000 the government will collapse
and you and your family will have nothing but your utterly atrophied street smarts to rely on (sorry, did I take that [too
far](https://luke.substack.com/p/seriously-how-are-americans-still)).

__Accountability and Reputation__:<br>
To get opportunities, you have to be known. To be known, you have to build credibility, which means taking accountability for things. If they work, great, you get the credit.
If they don't work, great, suck it up because unless you demonstrate courage and composure in dealing with the fall out, your credibility will faster than you can blink.

Celebrities and people who put their names on big, public things aren't stupid. They're confident that things will work. Elon Musk, Kanye, Oprah, Trump. Of course, they've
built up their reputations over decades of their careers, but remember that they didn't get to where they are without taking significant business risks under their *own
names*.

Enforcing accountability is easy in a [small](Harmony in its systemic and phenomenological aspects) team. Give everybody singular and [clear
responsibilities](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/run-startup-like-cult-heres/) and watch the magic happen. Of course, this requires high agency, high energy people, but
surely you see how the management problem is reduced with a smaller number of people.

To increase your compensation, you need to reduce your replaceability. Having the guts to be accountable for a lot of things, to put a lot on your plate,
is one way to be less replaceable. You need to be competent, but I think we've already covered that with the specific knowledge talk. If you're highly accountable,
you're probably key to the success of a business or any other venture. That means you will likely be rewarded with lots of equity and be given a big fat stick
of leverage off which to assert your influence.

Remember that accountability means you will be the first to suffer the consequences and the last to reap the rewards. A captain must go down with her ship, after all.
Equity holders are given the least priority in the liquidation of a business. But again, the downside is limited and the upside potentially unlimited. Besides, having a
failing business (at least in the startup infused Silicon Valley) isn't so much a scratch against your name as an integrity issue. Someone like Madoff, for example, has
ruined the name and therefore any chance at claiming accountability for generations. Can't imaging trusting a Madoff three generations down the line, can you?

Ref [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X) from Nassim Taleb.

__New World Leverage__:<br>
Labor is the oldest form of leverage. [A manager](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884) multiplies his output by the number of
people working under him. We are enamored with this kind of leverage, which is obvious from the way people react to hearing about promotions and how many people work
for you and how many followers you were able to amass. The issue is that labor is a fragile system that requires
[significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) [skill](https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197) to avoid a mutiny or general
lack of productivity.

Money is the next most obvious form of leverage. Money can buy you just about anything (except happiness, or so I hear). Money certainly scales better than labor, but
it carries the heavy tinge of unfairness. Money also requires significant skill to manage properly, but once those skills are mastered, they will bear fruit almost
endlessly (no question why money is our favorite compounding instrument). Money has helped quite a few people of the last century (Buffett being a big example) accumulate
a couple of pretty pennies.

New leverage comes in the form of products with 0 marginal cost, which basically means [code](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)
and media propagated over code (YouTube, podcasts, Twitch). Think PewDiePie, Joe Rogan, Gates, Zuckerberg, Brin, Jobs.

The sweet spot of money making cannons called unicorns is when just the right amount of labor and code and media combine to blow everybody's minds.

One of the reasons for the revolution in code + media as new levers is that they are permissionless. You don't need someone's permission to use them or create them. This
is enabled by the distribution networks like YouTube and Twitch and podcast streaming apps that have emerged over the past decade. Notice that these apps have also
democratized the experience of the content. The richest man in the world gets the same Amazon Prime or Netflix or Hulu or Disney Plus or YouTube or Google or Twitch experience
as the poorest person with Internet access (barring speed). This is in total contrast to the labor / capital dominated world, where something like a massage can be much better
if you have infinite money and labor. The egalitarian nature of these new infinite distribution products means they are positive sum. Everybody can share in this improved
quality of life and access to interesting materials. Even food is becoming democratized and homogenized by technology. We can all have access to McDonald's and meatballs from Costco
and Chick-Fil-A and prepared salads with argula and goat cheese and walnuts. The extra luxury experiences, like Michelin restaurants, are living off of their place in the status
game and are limited by their access to labor (service and chefs). Michelin restaurants and luxury experiences cater to rich people with status games to play. Things like Lamborghinis
or yachts or mansions or Sundance festival tickets are impractical and probably not nearly as well designed as the product with a budget amortized over the larger number of
middle class, or average, users.

Note that capital and labor are also becoming permissionless through digital disruption. Social networks leverage permissionless labor. Just look at all the people creating free content
for them. Permissioning mechanisms for capital are becoming unraveled by crowdfunding. Just look at all the nice people crowdfunding for their
[medical treatments](https://luke.substack.com/p/go-viral-or-die-trying).

Ok, I'm tired, so we're going to leave the next part about scale economics to another post.<br>
