Up until a couple of months ago, I either listened to music or the air conditioning in the car.
I had never had a good experience with podcasts up until that point (I simply can't stand
sitting around and *listening* to people. I much prefer reading.), which is why I held out,
but now I was desperate for something to keep me sane in the car. I downloaded a selection of
episodes from people I think are cool (honestly I don't remember my initial lineup) and started
to jam in my car. I feel undoubtedly happier while driving, hopefully smarter, and definitely
convinced that podcasts are the highest information density I can consume hands and eyes free
in my car. If you want the full list of what I've subscribed myself to, take a look at my
[page with recommendations for purveyors of information](../../../books_readings.html). Note
that I use Apple podcasts, possibly the worst app from Apple I've used to date. I've got so
many gripes about the stupid app, but I'll save that for the post on my [basic learnings about
how podcasts works](../14/how-podcasts-work.html).

This week's star podcast is the first I've listened to with
[Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com), self-proclaimed guru for living longer, healthier,
and optimizing performance (not exactly a grammatically parallel sentence...). I picked
[this one](https://peterattiamd.com/rickjohnson/) because it was going to talk about fructose,
something I recognize as sugar and pretty much only associate with fruit and a certain [college
professor](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/maura-d-dykstra) who has trouble digesting
fructose and with some of my sister's friends who are "allergic" to fruit. I figured these
smart people could educate me on fructose and how it can or cannot utterly destroy your
metabolic system (like most of foods people consume as staples these days). What follows is
notes I took on the show (some of them, I will admit, were taken while driving with AutoSteer
on). I know Peter [publishes his own notes](https://peterattiamd.com/rickjohnson/), but this 
is an exercise for my personal enrichment. I hope you enjoy them and will 
[send me](mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog) corrections and 
references for all the beautiful things that have piqued your 
[curiosity](../13/life-update-feb-2020.html).

__Topics covered__:
* How salt *actually* causes high blood pressure
* Uric Acid, what it is, and why it matters when it comes to your metabolic health
* Different types of sugar
  * How our relationship with fructose evolved (over millions of years ago)
  - What fructose does to your metabolic health
* What are the measures of metabolic health
* Some practical tips for helping you manage your metabolic health through salt intake, 
carbohydrate intake (esp. fructose), and umami intake

Rick's journey into the world of high blood pressure begins with his lab trying to understand 
how the kidney functions under high blood pressure. The going theory was that the kidney has 
an impaired ability to excrete [salt](#saltdown) under high blood pressure. Rick's team found that 
[hyperuricemia](***) (high uric acid) is a significant risk factor for high blood pressure [HBP]. 
In fact, raising uric acid in rats resulted in HBP! Fructose raises uric acid.

Before we go further into why uric acid metabolically matters, let's discuss salt and high blood 
pressure. Turns out that the *absolute* amount of salt is *not* what causes HBP. It's 
*concentration*, measured in mmol/L. If you eat some salty soup, your blood serum 
(part of blood that doesn't have clotting agents) osmolarity may go from 140mmol/L - 142mmol/L, 
which sounds very small but is to trigger a rise of about 6mmHg in blood pressure. 

160 - 180mmHg is the threshold point at which your risk for stroke from high blood pressure 
will shoot up. Why is that the case? Your body tries to control the pressure in its blood 
vessels by constricting them. According to the [equation of 
continuity](http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Bernoulli.html), a decrease in volume will 
increase velocity. [Bernoulli's equation](http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Bernoulli.html) 
then tells us that pressure will decrease in the areas where the vessels are constricted. There 
is a limit to how much blood pressure your body can fight off, which seems to be 160 - 180mmHg. 
The kidneys are one organ that uses vasoconstriction to control blood pressure. The brain also 
uses vasoconstriction, but because it's normally trying to maintain blood flow, it only uses
vasoconstriction in extreme cases. Older people lose their ability to autoregulate low blood 
pressure, so you really don't want to be on either extreme of the blood pressure range. 

The kidneys can develop a condition where they hold onto sodium. The reason is that there is 
t-cell and macrophage (white blood cell) induced inflammation in the kidneys. This inflammation 
leads to vasoconstriction, leading to ischemia (reduced blood flow), which leads to increased 
serum sodium osmolarity and tissue damage from reduced oxygen. If you give animals drugs that 
transiently reduce the blood flow to their kidneys, they will develop and inflammatory response 
and then get a permanent reduction in blood flow, which leads to the wonderful phenomenon of 
high blood pressure.

This inflammatory response can actually be an autoimmune response to heat shock proteins. Heat 
shock proteins are responsible for cleaning out misfolded proteins. When the kidney gets 
damaged, heat shock proteins may be produced to help the kidney recover. The immune system may 
become confused and attack those heat shock proteins, leading to inflammation and so on. Rick 
says that this is probably a mjaor mechanism for primary hypertension (essential hypertension, 
or hypertension without any clear cause).

Sugar is a major player in the initiation of HBP. Inflammation is a major player in the 
*persistence* of HBP. Increases in serum sodium activate an enzyme that converts glucose to 
fructose. Once this endogenously produced fructose is metabolized, the body develops HBP. 
Blocking fructose metabolism blocks the development of HBP.

What is sugar all about?   
Glucose (dextrose): This is the sugar that's measured in blood sugar. It's our primary 
carbohydrate fuel. It is stored in the tissues as glycogen.   
Fructose: Involved in energy storage. Present in fruit and honey. Tastes much sweeter than 
glucose. Generates uric acid when metabolized.
Sucrose (table sugar): 1:1 bonding of fructose and glucose. Occurs naturally in sugar cane and 
beets.   
HFCS (high fructose corn syrup): An unbonded mix of fructose and glucose.

Here's a summary of how sugar gets metabolized:
Glucose -> Pyruvate -> ATP
    * phosphate fructokinase -- turned off to stop glucose metabolism when ATP falls too low.
Fructose (fructokinase) -> phosphate fructose -1 ?? -> ....
    * Lowers energy in the cell during metabolism because it doesn't have stopped mechanism like 
    glucose metabolism does. UNREGULATED metabolism. 40-50% drop in ATP level, which is mayday 
    level. So body wants to conserve energy. Reduce metabolism, produce fat, induce hunger and 
    thirst.

    Intracellular phosphate also falls. AMPdeaminase takes AMP --> uric acid. (generation and 
    stimulation of fat, insulin resistance, fatty liver). AMPd is mediating a bunch of things 
    that uric acid does. 
ATP, ADP, AMP

can also go to AMPK and burn energy.

High fructose concentration --> big metabolic effects.

Animals use fructose to help store fat. You'll see animals eating tons of ripe fruit before 
they hibernate. We can understand the role of fructose and why humans have a remarkably sharp 
response to fructose by going back 20mil years, to when the first apes appear on the planet. 
Their primary food is fruit. At some point after the emergence of apes, a cool spell develops. 
Sea levels and temperatures fall. A land bridge emerges between Africa and Europe. Some apes 
take that land bridge to Europe. Fruit was still available in Europe at that first migration, 
but about 12mil years ago, the supply of fruits starts to run out. You can see signs of
intermittent starvation during winters in fossilized ape teeth. This starvation was mainly the 
result of the loss of the fig tree. By 6 - 8 mil years ago, apes go extinct in Europe. The only 
remaining apes are in Africa (where the forest merely retracted) and Asia. One mutation that 
emerged during this time (Myocene Period) was a mutation that reduced the efficacy of uricase 
(a uric acid enzyme). This means that uric acids are now perpetually much higher in animals 
with this mutation. Uric acid can help drive fructose-initiated fat production, so the apes 
that have this mutation can store fat much more easily. This mutation is likely the reason that 
a European ape was able to survive and migrate back to Africa and become the progenitor of 
our species.

Excess uric acid --> gout (crystallized uric acid entering joints and causing inflammation and 
pain). Gout was a wealthy person's disease, as was diabetes. Purines (nucleic acids) --> gout.
Because fructose metabolizes to uric acid, it exacerbates gout. SOLUBLE uric acid is the killer.
High uric acid --> metabolic syndrome.
Alopurinol blocks uric acid formation.

Why women have lesser uric acid than men: Estrogen helps excrete uric acid.

Metabolic effects of fructose are seen 4 hrs after ingestion. Any following morning results are 
totally nonsense.

What is metabolic syndrome (syndrome x)?
* Elevated blood glucose (insulin resistance)
* Elevated waist circumference (or is it increase in body fat percentage)
* High blood pressure
* Elevated triglycerides
* Low HDL cholsterol

Uric acid from fructose --> oxidative stress in mitochondria and islets of pancreas
Fructose --> lactate (affects mitochondria)
         --> decrease mitochondrial function and stimulates glycolysis

        enoyl coa hydrotase (in mitochondria) --> fat oxidation inhibited by fructose --> 
            block burning
        block aconitase --> block mitochondria function --> citrate --> fat generation -->
        fatty liver.

        Mitochondrial stress associated with insulin resistance.

20% fructose calories in high sugar low calorie diet. Diabetes, fatty liver, insulin resistance. 
First they are insulin resistant with *high serum insulin levels* (early Type 2). Over time,
insulin levels fall (type 1 diabetes), same process in humans. Islets get exhausted, but it's 
actually low-grade inflammation in islets. Upregulation of urate transportation proteins on 
islet. Uric acid oxidative stress on islets.

Net accumulation of fat in liver --> export as VLDL, drive up serum triglyceride.

Fructose is a survival nutrient. Fructose is also used in animals to store water. 
Store water in fat, burn the fat, metabolic water. Insulin resistance preserves glucose for the 
brain during starvation times. Fructose is also useful in a low oxygen state. Fructose 
stimulates glycolysis so they can survive in low-O2 state. Cancer cells love fructose for the 
same reason. Fructose reduces mitochondrial function glycolytic state.

Blocking fructokinase reduces cancer growth by 50%.

20% fructose used intenstine
40% by liver
10-20% escapes to circulation --> kidneys

fructokinase in brain, islets, adipose tissue

Heart produces fructokinase during heart attack to help repair and remodel heart.

Brain can *make* fructose. Insulin resistance just in brain --> ALzheimer's.
AMPD high in Alzheimer's brains.

There's some lucky people who have essential fructosuria, where they literally cannot 
metabolize fructose. This means they pretty much can't get diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

Hexokinase could metabolize fructose but normally metablizes glucose.


__Practical Tips and Fun Closing Tibits:__
Gout is an extracellular deposition. Uric acid acts intracellularly. Xanthene oxidase makes 
uric acid inside the cell. Febuxistan 

A high glucose diet may induce aldose reductase, which converts glucose to fructose. Excess  
carbohydrate can lead to fatty liver disease. This is why breads, which have very little 
raw added sucrose, can cause obesity. If you are obese or showing other symptoms of metabolic 
syndrome it is highly advised to go on low carb diet so your body can correct the damage from 
malnutrition.

Artificial sugar basically only activates 'sweet tasting' capacity. But sugar activates
other pathways so animals will eat real sugar even without sweet tasting gene.

Umami generated by glutamate, enhanced by purines like IMP and even uric acid. Umami 
is kind of a test for uric acid. Bypass the sugar pathway.

A cute demonstration on sugar.
Add some sugar to tea. Add the amount of sugar that's in soda to tea and watch them gag.

Dried fruit is basically all fructose. There's none of the good stuff left.
