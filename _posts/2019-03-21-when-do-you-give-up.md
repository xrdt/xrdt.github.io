Today's post is about knowing when to stop, giving up, when you've made
enough progress for the day, when to push, how much harder to push, and 
all that jazz that would be valid answers to the Jeopardy question: 
"When is enough enough?" 

I consider this question to be hugely fundamental to my life because 
time is an irrecoverable resource and because I want to minimize emotional 
frustration that leads to burnout <a href="#1down" id="1up">[1]</a>.

<p>From my own experience, burnout is primarily emotional. Time spent is a 
side-effect.</p>

<p>It's not how many hours you work, it's how much of your experience 
involves despair, frustration, and resentment. That might either be 
towards your employer ("stupid schedules, I'm not valued"), towards 
yourself ("this should be easy but I'm failing"), or towards the universe 
for simply not being the way it "should" be. </p>
