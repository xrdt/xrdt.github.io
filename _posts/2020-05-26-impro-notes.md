* This is an amazing book by the #1 in improv, Keith Johnstone.
* A brilliant quote on no discussions:
> My feeling is that the best argument may be a testimony to the skill of the
presenter, rather than to the excellence of the solution advocated. Also the
bulk of discussion time is visibly taken up with transactions of status which
have nothing to do with the problem to be solved.
* I took theater in high school because I felt it was the easiest of the art
options (orchestra, visual arts, a capella, etc). I never achieved any level of
comfort with it and held onto a sort of apathy for theater for through
college. This book has opened up a new vision of what training in theater
could be like. High/low status games; masks to reveal what we repress (
Johnstone reckons we "repress our benevolence and tenderness"); how to
unlock our spontaneity and trigger unthought answers in our stage partners;
blocking, accepting, and offering; learning to create stories on the spot; and
generally working with a theater master to unblock our inhibitions.
* In all of his exercises, Johnstone takes full responsibility for what
happens to the students. It is only with the assurance that the teacher is
there and will call things off when they start going off the cliff or that
a student cannot be held responsible for embarrassing or obscene or grotesque
things that emerge once their defenses are released can students fully
immerse themselves into the power of their unconscious minds.
* Venkatesh recommends this book more for its insights into social
interactions and body language and psychology; I find it fascinating because
of ties to unschooling and immersion in a more "natural" state of ourselves.
This "natural" state can be preempted by masks. The objective of the masks is
to get us to surrender control to a regressive force, one that is childlike
and playful and takes in so much more of the world than we do with our
standard ego defenses on. If you feel like surrendering your consciousness
to a mask is a sign of madness, Johnstone would say:
> the ability to become possessed is a sign of correct social adjustment, and
that really disturbed people censor themselves out. Either they *can't* do it,
or they're too afraid to even try. People who feel themselves at risk avoid
situations where they're likely to 'go to pieces'.
* Another good quote:
> Once we feel that art is self-expression, then the individual can be
criticsed not only for his skill or lack of skill, but simply for being what
he is.
  * Artists used to be mediums through which gods, spirits, whatever operated.
