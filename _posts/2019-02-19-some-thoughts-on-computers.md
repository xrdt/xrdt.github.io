1. Physical Abstractions

    The desktop is an abstraction of your physical desktop. The file system
    abstracts your file cabinet. The mouse button sometimes looks like a
    hand because it is supposed to represent your physical hand grabbing
    an object.

    The internet is just one large computer. It's a big computer made up of
    lots of smaller computers. Google and other search engines search through
    the Internet file system. Web addresses are like file paths on your local
    computer; they represent the sequence of nested file folders you have to
    open to get to your desired document. Your web browser is like your
    secretary, keeping track of where you've been and how you got there. The
    web browser also formats files as nicely as it can. Formatting can be
    hard, because sometimes files are in strange formats. When the Internet
    is slow, think about how some people are slow to deliver on promises or
    respond to your messages. This just means that subcomputer is
    underpowered. More people want to talk to it than it can talk to at one
    time.

    The internet is like an amusement park. You have to pay an entrance fee to
    an Internet Service Provider to get in. Once you're in, they will watch
    and record everything that you do. This amusement park never closes and
    pretty much has no rules, so you have to be careful to protect yourself.
    The [EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/tools) is an organization that wants
    to help protect you. You can download some of their protective tools from
    the link I attached.

    There is more to the internet and computers, like online advertising and
    hardware, but those leak beyond the physical abstractions. Feel free to
    use the internet to learn more about those [things](https://wikipedia.org).

2. Copy-Paste-Cut

    This is a computer only tool that is just brilliant. You want to move a
    whole paragraph of text you just wrote on your word processor? Swoosh,
    into your register it goes. You like what you just wrote? Well,
    congratulations, now you have a mini-propaganda horn! Go ahead and paste
    those few pieces of text everywhere with the simple keyboard shortcut
    <CTRL>-V (or Cmd-V). Unfortunately, most of us live with only one
    copy register. But you can certainly upgrade on
    [Mac](https://www.alfredapp.com) and ~sort of~ on
    [Windows](https://zapier.com/blog/best-clipboard-managers/) to get more
    registers. Who wouldn't want more propaganda horns? Toot! Toot!
