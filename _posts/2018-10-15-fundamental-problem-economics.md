[Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), as defined by Wikipedia,
is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and
consumption of goods and services. So,economics is effectively a study of
resource allocation. And yet, isn't it ironic that economics can't solve
problems like war, poverty, homelessness, rising housing prices, unemployment,
natural resource allocation, climate change, stagnation and collapse of the
hinterlands or rural areas, hunger, even though all those problems are
arguably just resource allocation issues? So we are clear about how the above
problems mentioned are resource allocation problems, I'm going to spell it
out below:
* War: Fight over resources like people, land, oil, water, money, power.
* Poverty: Uneven distribution of financial resources.
* Homelessness: Uneven distribution of financial and housing resources.
* Rising housing prices: Uneven distribution of population.
* Unemployment: Uneven distribution of financial resources and opportunity.
* Natural resource allocation: Uneven distribution of natural resources.
* Climate change: Improper management of natural resources, primarily caused
by excessive use.
* Stagnation and collapse of rural areas: Uneven distribution of wealth across
landmass which causes people to mass migrate to cities and aggravate
rising housing prices, unemployment, homeslessn, and poverty.
* Hunger: Uneven distribution of food resources.

Is it clear now that economics, for all the Nobel Prizes that have been
awarded to scholars of the field, and for all the priority it takes in the
minds of our government, has failed to serve society.

Why has economics failed? What fundamental assumptions has economics made that
have distorted its models? It has ignored the humanity of its subjects. It
has ignored fundamental human needs and desires and sought to capture us as
computers. Rather than speak of motivation or desire for purpose and
fulfillment, economics has quantified our decision-making process into
cost-benefit analysis or utility calculations. Rather than understand limits
to growth and place appropriate priorities on what we should be growing,
economics has placed growth on the central pedestal and urged, no, demanded
that governments, businesses, all entities worship growth as the central
engine for their existences. And what growth is valued? Growth of numbers!
We're talking numbers like income, revenue, headcount, MAU. But the ultimate
number is income growth! We want to see consistent 50% revenue, income,
MAU growth because how else could a business be healthy and happy if it
weren't growing? To stagnate is the lot of old people, and we all know how
they end up.

Just as it is reductionist and insufficient to quantify performance of a
machine learning model with one error statstic, it is insufficient to
quantify progress and contribution to society by the one metric of growth or
even the two metrics of growth and size. Have you ever considered it
paradoxical that, the bigger companies get, the more they want to develop
small subunits? They realize that at some point, the energy required to
maintain a large system outstrips the benefit of the large structure and that
so-called economies of scale disappear beyond a certain size. So they split,
and they split, because they want to stay small and scrappy. They want to keep
up with the young upstarts that are threatening their monopolies. They want
to feel young and alive again.

But the drive for small is driven by productivity numbers. It disregards
the real reason to be small: to allow for each member of the group to
contribute in a significant way towards the group's objective.
If you believe that teamwork can be defined as individual commitment towards
a group effort then surely you realize that you cannot inspire individual
commitment with Powerpoints about group productivity. People become motivated
when they believe in the objective. Motivation must spring towards an
objective. Thus, in order to effectively inspire, form, and lead groups to
achieve great things, you must identify and clearly communicate the
fundamental objectives. You must ask that each person commits to the project
on the basis of alignment of objectives with personal priorities. Only then
will you get true commitment and progress.

This is precisely the kind of human behavior that economics ignores. It
disregards the contribution of a community leader towards morale and community
cohesion because his productivity cannot be quantified. You cannot run A/B
tests on having this leader or not having this leader because people change
around and in between the leadership changes. There is no control group
because people are complicated, and unexpected, and this is what makes people
beautiful and wonderful. And, again, economics seeks to harden people's
hearts, to encourage them to view the world in terms of base calculations of
utility, to accept selfishness, to believe that incentives are what creates
behavior, to encourage greed, and to discourage long-term thinking. Economics
draws people away from the higher values in life. In fact, economics
discourages the construction of such hierarchies of good and bad in life,
preferring the spectrum of relativism that utilitarianism and discounting
can provide. Rather than pursuing a goal based on higher values of
beauty, love, compassion, brotherhood, sustainability, or stewardship,
economics asks that you put away your humanity (not your cell phone) so you
can make "rational" decisions.

It is this thinking that has plagued us for too long. We are rapidly losing
our natural environment. We are rapidly depleting natural resources. We have
lost the good-old-fashioned values of decades past. We have lost trust. We have
lost compassion. We have become enamored with competition. We have lost
the American Dream. We have lost the family. We have lost all that feeds our
souls, all that really matters to us, in favor of what? More money? Bigger
cities that are plagued with disease, filth, homelessness, aloofness,
coldness, loneliness, unemployment, indifference, poverty? Overcrowded
vacation destinations like Hawaii, Jamaica, Tahiti, Aspen? Longer hours?
More wars? An increase in exitenstial crises? An increase in belief in
pointlessness in life? Increase in terrorism and corruption?

If these aren't the things you value, you can begin to turn around your life
by simply choosing to pursue those things which will truly give you
personal fulfillment. It's not death that you should fear; it's living a bad
life that should keep you up at night.
