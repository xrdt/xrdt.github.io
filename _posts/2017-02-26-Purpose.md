title: Purpose

I recently finished reading part one of Victor Frankl's _Man's Search for Meaning._ I've hit a very low point in life and have been looking for a way out. Perhaps, in this thin volume, I would be able to find the path to freedom that I increasingly longed for. 

There are no formulas to solving these abstract problems. The best we can do is develop heuristics and approximations which locally optimize our life choices.
