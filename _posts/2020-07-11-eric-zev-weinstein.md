Order of notes do not necessarily map to chronological order of relevant mention
in the podcast.

Eric opens this episode with a soliloquy on taste which I found absolutely
brilliant.
* We've lost a shared cultural taste.
  * If people don't share taste, your only recourse is to lean against the
  authority of the law and law enforcement authorities.
    * One example is carnivores vs vegans. It's not interesting to hear
    carnivores and vegans discussing the optimal diet because they don't share
    taste. The discussion will devolve into an intractable argument. It's far
    more interesting to hear a carnivore v carnivore or vegan v vegan argument
    because they can actually get into the nuances of their shared taste.
    * Rules and law are an attempt to impose a shared taste.
  * Nowadays, people can't tell the difference between taste and hateful abuse.
  We're also afraid to slight people on matters of taste because everything gets
  taken as more serious, as more literal, as more objective than it actually is.
  How do we go back to communicating taste publicly?
* Some of Eric's pieces of taste:
  * Why do debates about free will vs determinism, God vs no God, lifers vs
  choicers keep getting stuck in the same place?
  * Why do we keep mining for leadership among the Baby Boomers?
  Why is there no mass protest about the options we have for President this year
  (77yr old vs 74 yr old)? Are these signs that the US is becoming a failed
  state?
  * Modern social justice wants to undo logic, science, due process, and rule of
  law.
  * You should spend more time in unforgiving fields like science and sports so
  you can learn to see the world without the filter of expert opinion.
  * Taste > laws in the affairs of men.
  * Your time would be well spent on working to build your country into one with
  a modern, moderate government with strong national identity and a modest
  immigration policy.

Eric shares a few more pieces of personal taste that I haven't transcribed here.

Now onto the notes from Eric's conversation with Zev.
* It feels like there are no older generations to look to for guidance on modern
problems.
* 1950-1965 was the golden age for modern biology. DNA, Chargaff experiment,
genetic code, hemoglobin, etc.
  * We had a nice modern breakthrough with the Human Genome Project but it
  certainly doesn't feel like society is acknowledge this progress.
  * There is of course a consideration to be made about fundamental vs
  refinement type of progress.
* Culture has destroyed the polymath.
* There were a bunch of dangerous ideologies floating around in the 20th century
that were stamped out through war.
  * Colonialism, Fascism, Radical Nationalism, Apartheid.
  * Could it be that these ideas could only have been rooted out through
  violence?
* Zev: Morality is a proxy for the fitness of a society.
  * Only societies with strong social commandments can be stable and survive.
   Immoral societies collapse.
   * The exception is that China doesn't seem to be paying the price for
   authoritarianism. It is borrowing all the good mechanical advances from
   capitalist society through its parasitic, government controlled companies.
* We no longer have a positive model of masculinity. But, women seem to favor
"traditionally" masculine men when they want to start families. Look at that
biology (potentially) overriding social "sense-making".
* The four parameters of music: lyrics, melody, harmony, rhythm.
  * There is some efficient frontier of these four parameters that bands like
  the Beach Boys but not modern bands with their [repetitive
  lyrics](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/) fall on.
  * Tom Lehrer (another point of taste for the Weinstein's) is a national
  treasure trove of children's music. Tom doesn't gloss over the nasty and
  pointy parts of society, like prostitution or death.
* Zev's favorite poem (or maybe most important to his intellectual development):
[EE Cumming's "The Boys I Mean Are Not
Refined"](https://genius.com/E-e-cummings-the-boys-i-mean-are-not-refined-annotated).
Ref Elon Musk "shak[ing] the mountains when [he] dance[s]".
