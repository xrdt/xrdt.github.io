A broken record that keeps repeating itself is using the repetition as a
signal that something is wrong. People who keep repeating themselves to you
are signaling that they don't feel they are being heard. Repeatedly failing
a class signals that you haven't actually learned any more from the subsequent
iterations than you did on the first. Walking down the same path in a maze
signals that you are lost and that no, you shouldn't have made a left at that
intersection. When your life keeps repeating itself, it's a signal that you
are neglecting something important, something critical to your happiness and
fulfillment and productivity.

What does it mean for life to repeat itself?
