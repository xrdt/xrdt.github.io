I keep wanting to write Dec X when I title my blogs. I also keep writing MM/DD/17 on my notes. I need to adjust to the new year.

Pasadena has begun it’s yearly journey into the wetter part of the year. We’ve had two days of rain now, and while the rest of the seven-day forecast looks clear, we should be expecting more wetness for the rest of the season. I’m excited because it’s a pleasant deviation from the standard sun and blue skies of Southern California, but I’m a bit peeved at how easily rainwater gets on my clothing. I have a nice pair of [waterproof Khombu boots](http://costcocouple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Khombu-Ladies-Nordic-Boot-Costco-2.jpg) that I could wear, but I feel a bit ridiculous wearing something so intense. Then again, I’d rather be ridiculous than deal with wet running shoes and socks each time I go outside.

雨飄這在窗上 滴答滴答的想著<br>
總部改變的一片黑雲蓋著世界各地<br>
外面平常轟隆的人群突然失縱<br>
今天是一個坐在屋簷下沉思的一天<br>
<br>
火爐上的水壺開始呼嘯著<br>
我要去紓解他的痛苦<br>
水燒的舒服泡杯茶來陪我一起沉思<br>
<br>
想起小時候有天祈禱這神擺脫明天會是大下雨天<br>
出乎意料真的實現我的禱告<br>
那天學校活動全急急忙忙地把設備移進教室<br>
現在的我不可能有那種願望了<br>
現在的我想要外面成一片白雪 掩蓋土地的傷痕<br>
