__Books__:
* __[How Children Learn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201484048)__
  * I'm continuing on my quest to absorb as much of the material that was
  produced during the American education revolution of the 1960s / 1970s. I came
  into this book hoping for some more concrete ideas on how to reform education
  and properly help children learn. I left realizing that the only thing
  necessary to help children learn is to regard them with love and respect. Once
  we can stop [seeing children as less than human](https://t.co/o8KUnFqUqh) and
  instead see them as amazing beings that are full of the same machinery and
  capacity for emotion and models of the world as adults or even just older
  people, we can begin our work of making sure our children never starve for
  materials. We just need to keep filling their curiosity with as high quality
  materials as possible. When children ask for more, we provide more and leave
  it at that. The rest we trust them to come up with. When they get scared, we
  are there to be a rock, a foundation for them to stabilize themselves against
  and regain the courage to do more exploring. When they get tired, we let them
  rest. We let them take things at their own pace and into their own directions,
  because this is the only way things stick onto our mental models and this is
  the only way we can ensure our children will continue to explore.
  * I happened to read a version of the book that had revisions to the original
  text. The revisions are immensely useful, because they add lots of color on
  where John overstepped his bounds as a "teacher" and on related materials,
  like [Seymour Papert's
  Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746).
  * I could not be more happy to have finished this book and to have known that
  there was such a man who once existed and who was interested enough in sharing
  his experiences with the rest of us blind but eager fools.

__Podcasts (Most of these are so good I might relisten to them)__:
* [Ezra Klein and Rutger Bregman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-humans-fundamentally-good-with-rutger-bregman/id1081584611?i=1000476380401)
  * I get more and more impressed with Ezra's intellect the more I listen to
  him. I'm highly unimpressed with Rutger. He seems to literally just not get
  the points that Ezra is bringing up about people's desire for hierarchy and
  the highly Christian bent of his philosophy and the uncertainty around what
  leadership in primitive tribes is really like. It's not quite as frustrating
  to listen to Rutger as it was to listen to [Nathan
  Robinson](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/1/7/21055676/nathan-robinson-ezra-klein-socialism-bernie-sanders)
  go on and on in this impassioned SJW kind of way about how evil and blind to
  the imbalances in society rich people like Pete Buttigieg are, but it's still
  annoying to see Ezra make sharp points that land very flat against his
  conversation partner. Anyway, I highly recommend this episode just to see Ezra
  mentally flex and come to his own conclusions about human nature and non
  complimentarity and open schools and accepting collateral evil as a necessary
  feature of a society where trust is the dominant mode of operations.
* [Exponent Scale Scale Scale](https://exponent.fm/episode-182-scale-scale-scale/)
  * This is an amazing episode just in terms of education myself about how the
  world works. I try to read Stratechery, but I often get bored, so listening
  to him debate with James (who obviously hasn't the time or luxury to think
  through the issues Ben writes about with as much care or depth as Ben but is
  a super genial and fun conversation partner) about deep issues in tech and
  business building and FTC and so on is my way of increasing my input of Ben's
  thinking into my mental model builders. This episode goes over the nature of
  the CPG business (scale!) and whether new "internet" companies like Harry's
  really have cost structures that can make them successful on the Internet and
  why companies like Harry's often feel like they can't compete on the Internet
  with digital advertising and therefore choose to transition to brick and
  mortar. They also get into why we feel uncomfortable about FB's market power
  and what the right way to think about antitrust for companies like FB is
  (probably not consumer welfare). They bring up the fascinating question of
  whether breaking up companies like FB and IG actually prevents them from
  coming back together in the future. The breaking up of Mama Bell is a great
  example. We only have three major cell network providers in the US because,
  well, it's a market that runs on scale! That means that companies are going to
  consolidate until there's only a few players left with the capital to continue
  to exist. Ben also talks about why he's bullish on local news and why most
  newspapers have absolutely floundered in taking their content to the Internet.
  You can't fight the scale and the algorithms of the internet by churning out
  heaps of SEO-optimized garbage. You need to up your value proposition and
  become a destination for high quality or highly relevant (localized)
  information. [Individuals are increasingly using tools like
  Substack](https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1280191542750097409) to
  capitalize on their own ability to provide value and going independent. I love
  listening to Ben, but dang, this is one of the first episodes where I *really*
  felt like Ben hit hard and his ideas had ground on the stone long enough to be
  beyond razor sharp.
* [My First Million](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/83-how-koch-brothers-got-rich-human-ipos-why-snapchat/id1469759170?i=1000477698584)
  * My First Million is always fun for the hustle that Shaan and Sam,
  especially, bring to the table. It's a flavor of getting rich or doing
  interesting things that isn't quite the standard slap together some code and
  make money that dominates the minds of young CS graduates from Stanford who
  can't escape the hive mind and physical bubble of the Bay. That flavor,
  though, is undoubtedly influenced by the Bay.
  * In this episode, they talk about the Koch brothers, who run a conglomerate
  that makes tons of money and literally owns businesses in just about anything
  petroleum (refined and raw) and [tons of other
  industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Industries). They then bring
  up the [Happy Body
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Body-Nutrition-Exercise-Relaxation/dp/098240381X),
  which Shaan has been following to great success and which Sam, who has
  apparently been getting jacked, is going to buy and devour. Those were the two
  main takeaways I took out of the episode, though you might find something more
  interesting in the show notes included in the link.
* [Paul Saladino and Elle Russ](https://paulsaladinomd.libsyn.com/how-to-fix-your-thyroid-with-elle-russ)
  * I love Paul because he's so genuinely earnest and passionate about being
  radically carnivore. This episode is super boss not only because Elle speaks
  super fast and keeps the energy up but because she gets way into how the heck
  your thyroid works (and why it's important to look there first for most health
  wackiness) and then goes super deep with Paul on all the crazy chemicals that
  want to kill you in broccoli and cassava and brassicas vegetables and how low
  carb can help your thyroid function. Paul put *tons* of scientific references
  in the show notes, in case you want to fact check or just go deeper into
  anything they discussed. This is a real hard hitting episode. Please check it
  out. Meanwhile, I'm going to buy Paul's book.
