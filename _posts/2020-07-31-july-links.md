__Books__:
* __[How Children Learn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201484048)__
  * I'm continuing on my quest to absorb as much of the material that was
  produced during the American education revolution of the 1960s / 1970s. I came
  into this book hoping for some more concrete ideas on how to reform education
  and properly help children learn. I left realizing that the only thing
  necessary to help children learn is to regard them with love and respect. Once
  we can stop [seeing children as less than human](https://t.co/o8KUnFqUqh) and
  instead see them as amazing beings that are full of the same machinery and
  capacity for emotion and models of the world as adults or even just older
  people, we can begin our work of making sure our children never starve for
  materials. We just need to keep filling their curiosity with as high quality
  materials as possible. When children ask for more, we provide more and leave
  it at that. The rest we trust them to come up with. When they get scared, we
  are there to be a rock, a foundation for them to stabilize themselves against
  and regain the courage to do more exploring. When they get tired, we let them
  rest. We let them take things at their own pace and into their own directions,
  because this is the only way things stick onto our mental models and this is
  the only way we can ensure our children will continue to explore.
  * I happened to read a version of the book that had revisions to the original
  text. The revisions are immensely useful, because they add lots of color on
  where John overstepped his bounds as a "teacher" and on related materials,
  like [Seymour Papert's
  Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746).
  * I could not be more happy to have finished this book and to have known that
  there was such a man who once existed and who was interested enough in sharing
  his experiences with the rest of us blind but eager fools.
