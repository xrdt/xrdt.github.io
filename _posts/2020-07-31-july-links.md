__Books__:
* __[How Children Learn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201484048)__
  * I'm continuing on my quest to absorb as much of the material that was
  produced during the American education revolution of the 1960s / 1970s. I came
  into this book hoping for some more concrete ideas on how to reform education
  and properly help children learn. I left realizing that the only thing
  necessary to help children learn is to regard them with love and respect. Once
  we can stop [seeing children as less than human](https://t.co/o8KUnFqUqh) and
  instead see them as amazing beings that are full of the same machinery and
  capacity for emotion and models of the world as adults or even just older
  people, we can begin our work of making sure our children never starve for
  materials. We just need to keep filling their curiosity with as high quality
  materials as possible. When children ask for more, we provide more and leave
  it at that. The rest we trust them to come up with. When they get scared, we
  are there to be a rock, a foundation for them to stabilize themselves against
  and regain the courage to do more exploring. When they get tired, we let them
  rest. We let them take things at their own pace and into their own directions,
  because this is the only way things stick onto our mental models and this is
  the only way we can ensure our children will continue to explore.
  * I happened to read a version of the book that had revisions to the original
  text. The revisions are immensely useful, because they add lots of color on
  where John overstepped his bounds as a "teacher" and on related materials,
  like [Seymour Papert's
  Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746).
  * I could not be more happy to have finished this book and to have known that
  there was such a man who once existed and who was interested enough in sharing
  his experiences with the rest of us blind but eager fools.
* __[Never Too Late](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Too-Late-Musical-Story/dp/0201567636)__
  * Another good book by John Holt. This time, he's talking about his journey in
  learning to play the cello as an adult.

__Podcasts (Most of these are so good I might relisten to them)__:
* [Ezra Klein and Rutger Bregman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-humans-fundamentally-good-with-rutger-bregman/id1081584611?i=1000476380401)
  * I get more and more impressed with Ezra's intellect the more I listen to
  him. I'm highly unimpressed with Rutger. He seems to literally just not get
  the points that Ezra is bringing up about people's desire for hierarchy and
  the highly Christian bent of his philosophy and the uncertainty around what
  leadership in primitive tribes is really like. It's not quite as frustrating
  to listen to Rutger as it was to listen to [Nathan
  Robinson](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/1/7/21055676/nathan-robinson-ezra-klein-socialism-bernie-sanders)
  go on and on in this impassioned SJW kind of way about how evil and blind to
  the imbalances in society rich people like Pete Buttigieg are, but it's still
  annoying to see Ezra make sharp points that land very flat against his
  conversation partner. Anyway, I highly recommend this episode just to see Ezra
  mentally flex and come to his own conclusions about human nature and non
  complimentarity and open schools and accepting collateral evil as a necessary
  feature of a society where trust is the dominant mode of operations.
* [Exponent Scale Scale Scale](https://exponent.fm/episode-182-scale-scale-scale/)
  * This is an amazing episode just in terms of education myself about how the
  world works. I try to read Stratechery, but I often get bored, so listening
  to him debate with James (who obviously hasn't the time or luxury to think
  through the issues Ben writes about with as much care or depth as Ben but is
  a super genial and fun conversation partner) about deep issues in tech and
  business building and FTC and so on is my way of increasing my input of Ben's
  thinking into my mental model builders. This episode goes over the nature of
  the CPG business (scale!) and whether new "internet" companies like Harry's
  really have cost structures that can make them successful on the Internet and
  why companies like Harry's often feel like they can't compete on the Internet
  with digital advertising and therefore choose to transition to brick and
  mortar. They also get into why we feel uncomfortable about FB's market power
  and what the right way to think about antitrust for companies like FB is
  (probably not consumer welfare). They bring up the fascinating question of
  whether breaking up companies like FB and IG actually prevents them from
  coming back together in the future. The breaking up of Mama Bell is a great
  example. We only have three major cell network providers in the US because,
  well, it's a market that runs on scale! That means that companies are going to
  consolidate until there's only a few players left with the capital to continue
  to exist. Ben also talks about why he's bullish on local news and why most
  newspapers have absolutely floundered in taking their content to the Internet.
  You can't fight the scale and the algorithms of the internet by churning out
  heaps of SEO-optimized garbage. You need to up your value proposition and
  become a destination for high quality or highly relevant (localized)
  information. [Individuals are increasingly using tools like
  Substack](https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1280191542750097409) to
  capitalize on their own ability to provide value and going independent. I love
  listening to Ben, but dang, this is one of the first episodes where I *really*
  felt like Ben hit hard and his ideas had ground on the stone long enough to be
  beyond razor sharp.
* [My First Million](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/83-how-koch-brothers-got-rich-human-ipos-why-snapchat/id1469759170?i=1000477698584)
  * My First Million is always fun for the hustle that Shaan and Sam,
  especially, bring to the table. It's a flavor of getting rich or doing
  interesting things that isn't quite the standard slap together some code and
  make money that dominates the minds of young CS graduates from Stanford who
  can't escape the hive mind and physical bubble of the Bay. That flavor,
  though, is undoubtedly influenced by the Bay.
  * In this episode, they talk about the Koch brothers, who run a conglomerate
  that makes tons of money and literally owns businesses in just about anything
  petroleum (refined and raw) and [tons of other
  industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Industries). They then bring
  up the [Happy Body
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Body-Nutrition-Exercise-Relaxation/dp/098240381X),
  which Shaan has been following to great success and which Sam, who has
  apparently been getting jacked, is going to buy and devour. Those were the two
  main takeaways I took out of the episode, though you might find something more
  interesting in the show notes included in the link.
* [Paul Saladino and Elle Russ](https://paulsaladinomd.libsyn.com/how-to-fix-your-thyroid-with-elle-russ)
  * I love Paul because he's so genuinely earnest and passionate about being
  radically carnivore. This episode is super boss not only because Elle speaks
  super fast and keeps the energy up but because she gets way into how the heck
  your thyroid works (and why it's important to look there first for most health
  wackiness) and then goes super deep with Paul on all the crazy chemicals that
  want to kill you in broccoli and cassava and brassicas vegetables and how low
  carb can help your thyroid function. Paul put *tons* of scientific references
  in the show notes, in case you want to fact check or just go deeper into
  anything they discussed. This is a real hard hitting episode. Please check it
  out. Meanwhile, I'm going to buy Paul's book.
* [Covid, Free Speech, and Lies](https://exponent.fm/episode-184-good-is-better-than-perfect/)
  * Notes to come
* [Eric Weinstein and His Son](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/34-zev-weinstein-on-parenting-boys-generation-z/id1469999563?i=1000474506222)
  * Notes to come

I saw the ShowHN on HackerNews around two months ago, lost the link to it, and
now it's reappeared on HN Classic.

* [Steven Sinofsky on
Apple](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/apples-relentless-strategy-and-execution-7544a76aa26)
  * The starting point is Apple's recent announcement of Apple Silicon, the new
  custom silicon that will power Macs. The transition will happen over the next
  two years.
  * Three things Sinofsky thinks Apple has clearly demonstrated extraordinary
  ability in:
    * Fearless multi-year strategy
    * Clear unified planning/prioritization
    * Wildly unprecedented execution
  * Quote on Microsoft and their commitment to being an enterprise company:
    > There’s a whole book to be written about the “deal” a company makes to
    become an enterprise company and to promise compatibility. The reward of
    success is extremely high, but it is almost a Faustian bargain because you
    will absolutely cede the right to innovate.
* Elinor Ostrom's [Design
Principles for Common Pool Resource
Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR\)\_institution)
  * I found this somewhere in a comment on HackerNews. Seems like a fairly
  common sense framework, but [reality is more complicated than you
  think](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail).
* [This](https://www.arcpublishing.com) was mentioned on a [My First
Million](https://thehustle.co/why-wapo-copying-amazon/) episode as an example of
ways companies can turn their internal tooling into distinct products that
then become bigger than the originating entities. AWS is the highest profile
example of this business model. Of course, as has been discussed on
[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com) and [Exponent](https://exponent.fm),
a strategy is a cohesive set of actions that make sense in a context. This
means that, as attractive as any business model may be, not every company can
change their cost structure or revenue stream commitments or org structure to
support a new way of building / selling / producing value.
* I'm fascinated by this HackerNews thread on [Expert
Beginners](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23767438). I'm early into my
career, but I have this strong fear that I'm already on the road towards
becoming an Expert Beginner (is this just imposter syndrome?).
  * [Well written comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23774504) on the
  demographic change from hobbyist / passion programmers towards professional
  programmers who just want to keep their job. It also talks about how the lack
  of standard certification (which comes from the dynamic, amorphous nature of
  the field and its tools) has led to the whiteboarding interview.
  * There are other comments on how hard it is to progress past plateaus of
  learning and on how the number of materials / tutorials for learning rapidly
  decreases once one gets past the beginner tutorials. Pretty soon you're onto
  learning from research papers.
* [New productivity app!!](http://amie.so)
* [Stratechery on the Utterly Lacking Uber
S-1](https://stratechery.com/2019/uber-questions/)
  * Ben debates the Personal Mobility value proposition of Uber, their
  advantages against Lyft, how they could win in the autonomous vehicles space,
  and how little information Uber has included in their S-1.
* [Stratechery on How Disney's Streaming Services Are Adapting to the Free
Distribution World of the
Internet](https://stratechery.com/2019/disney-and-the-future-of-tv/)
  * Even if studying history is somewhat useless because we tend to do too
  much useless pattern matching to rhyming contexts, it's still interesting to
  learn about the history and evolution of [tech
  conglomerates in industries like cable
  television](http://investorfieldguide.com/collison/).
  * Main points:
    * Because the Internet has enabled free and limitless distribution, the
    number of jobs that can be served through the Internet has dramatically
    increased.
    * Sports / news TV are best consumed live and thus are better suited for the
    traditional cable distribution model. Sports also has the advantage of
    having natural breaks for advertising. The high level of individual
    preference in sports viewing also means that consumers will pay for access
    to sports bundles and content distributors can charge high fees to
    distributors. ESPN+ is a nice addition that allows ESPN to make use of its
    streaming rights for less popular sports, but the above listings make sports
    and ESPN highly suited for a wide distribution business model.
    * Disney+ is all about driving the [Disney movies + merchandising + theme
    park attractions
    flywheel](https://kottke.org/15/06/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart).
    It's cheap because Disney wants to attract and retain as much traffic as
    possible. Lifetime value of a Disney customer is much higher than the gains
    from charging a higher price and getting to profitability (currently
    projected to 2024) sooner.
    * Hulu is a Netflix hedge.
    * Closing thought from Ben: focus on the job(s) to be done.
* [Stratechery on How to Regulate the
Internet](https://stratechery.com/2019/a-regulatory-framework-for-the-internet/)
  * Main points:
    * Existing legislation has either entrenched the large players (FB / GOOG)
    or practically demanded that platforms filter content or spy on traffic.
    * We want free speech but we don't want child exploitation or hate crime
    videos to be spread all over the internet.
    * FB and Goog and Super Aggregators that facilitate interactions between
    free users, free content creators (who could be users), and paying
    advertisers. These platforms serve their customers, the advertisers, by
    getting them as many eyeballs as possible. This means serving content people
    want, which ranges from "the beautiful to the profane". Because users don't
    pay for the service, their boycotting or other dissenting actions doesn't
    have a direct impact on the platform's bottom line. Advertisers also don't
    have much of any incentive to boycott the platforms, so the money just keeps
    flowing in.
    * The focus of regulation, then, should be on this category of ad-supported
    businesses where there is a market failure. There is a fundamental
    disconnect between supply (content) and monetization and consumption which
    is not present with Internet infrastructure (ISPs) and other directly paid
    applications (Azure / AWS / self or shared hosting). Keep the Internet free
    in the other cases.
* [Stratechery on How Satya Nadella Ended Windows](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/)
  1. Office on iPad and Windows Azure --> Microsoft Azure
    * Microsoft will serve non-Windows and Windows platforms.
  2. Windows 10
    * Temp retreat to fix the hatred for Windows 8.
  3. Reorg
    * From Ballmer's One Microsoft to Cloud and Enterprise ; Applications and
    Services ; Windows and Devices. The Windows (and other non-core groups like
    Surface) team was left out to come to terms with the reality of its end by
    itself. No need to waste political capital by directly axing the group.
  4. What's the next growth vector?
    * Microsoft has successfully undone the Ballmer damage of functional
    organization and become a divisional org. Whether Microsoft can find a cash
    cow as successful as Windows to build its next few decades of growth upon
    remains to be seen. Azure is still second to AWS; Office365 isn't
    particularly strong as a general productivity suite.
* [Stratechery on MSFT vs Zoom vs
Slack in the SaaS
Space](https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-slack-zoom-and-the-saas-opportunity/)
  * The main point is to study [this chart](https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23.png)
  and realize that the major challenge facing MSFT relative to the other hot
  up and coming SaaS players is that MSFT doesn't have a clear way to grow its
  user base.

__China Studies__:
* I'm currently slowly working my way through the [Ladanyi China News Analysis
Archives](http://www.ladanyi.ch/china-news-analysis/). It's been slow, grueling
work, but absolutely worth it for an understanding of a country that may very
soon replace the US as the geopolitical kingpin.
* When studying the early days of Communist China, you must study the root of
the Chinese thinking -- Mao Ze Dong's work. The first piece I've read is
"On New Democracy" ([中](http://chinatide.net/xiachao/23.html),
[English](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm#bm1)).
* [China's ideological war and Tik Tok's place in
it](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/)
  * TikTok is a crazy successful information manipulation vector for China
  because it leverages the human preference for moving pictures over text or
  static images, and pulls content from the global pool of contributors (not
  just a user's social network).
  * China's greatest fear is that (Western) liberalism will push out Marxism as
  the one world truth. TikTok, We Chat, etc, are all Chinese tools that further
  the political objective of making sure that Marxism survives as the single
  ideological truth (you live I die). Western governments (esp US) need to step
  up and fight for peace and liberalism by passing legislation on data privacy
  and limiting global Chinese influence (cutting off highly effective influence
  vectors like TikTok).
  * This is an absolutely amazing speech on
[XiJinPing and modern
China](https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in). Main
points:
  * "the formal ideology of communism coexists with an unofficial ideology of old
  China". This is also becoming clear from my reading of the archives of
  Ladanyi's China News Analysis. Chinese people have a strong love and respect
  for their culture (just look at how many TV serials are imperial Chinese court
  dramas), especially the stories about the rise and fall of dynasties. Even
  today, you'd probably be hard pressed to find Chinese people who don't know by
  heart the stories of the Three Kingdoms and Sun Wu Kong or who isn't familiar
  with the narratives of the other [Four Classic Chinese
  Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Chinese_Novels).
  * XiJinPing is an ideological monster. We haven't seen this level of
  insistence on ideological perfection since the Cultural Revolution. The
  underlying view:
  > In the view of China’s princelings - or “Revolutionary Successors”, as they
  prefer to be known - China is still trapped in the cycle which had created and
  destroyed every dynasty that had gone before. In this tradition, when you lose
  political power you don’t just lost your job (while keeping your super) as you
  might in our rather gentrified arrangement. You lose your wealth, you lose
  your freedom, you probably lose your life and possibly your entire extended
  family. You are literally erased from history. Winners take all and losers
  lose everything.
  * The written work that provided Mao and now Xi a way out of this endless
  cycle of eventual collapse was Stalin's _Short Course_:
  > The most original insight in Stalin’s _Short Course on the History of the
  Bolsheviks_ is that the path to socialist utopia will always be obstructed by
  enemies who want to restore bourgeois capitalism from inside the party. These
  internal enemies grow more desperate and more dangerous as they grow
  increasingly imperilled - and as they collaborate with the spies and agents of
  Western liberalism.
  > ... What Stalin offered Mao was not only a manual for purging his peers but
  also an explanation of why it was necessary. Purging his rivals was the only
  way a vanguard party could “purify” itself, remain true to its revolutionary
  nature and prevent a capitalist restoration.
  * Xi is claiming to be the Revolutionary Successor to Mao:
  > Xi’s language of “party purity”; “criticism and self-criticism”; “the mass
  line”; his obsession with “unity”; his attacks on elements of “hostile Western
  liberalism”, “constitutionalism” and other variants of ideological
  “subversion” -  this is all Marxism-Leninism as interpreted by Stalin as
  interpreted by Mao.
  * The continual purges and social engineering and "tempering" and engineering
  of the human soul will never end in Communist China:
  > Importantly, the Communist Party never sought to “persuade” so much as
  “condition”. By creating a fully enclosed system, controlling all incentives
  and disincentives, and “breaking” individuals physically, socially and
  psychologically, they found they could condition the human mind in the same
  way that Pavlov had learned to condition dogs in a Moscow laboratory a few
  years earlier.
  > The Western conspiracy to infiltrate, subvert and overthrow the People’s
  Party is not contingent on what any particular Western country thinks or does.
  It is an equation, a mathematical identity: the CCP exists and therefore it is
  under attack.
  * And the seven Western false trends:
  > Western constitutional democracy - “an attempt to undermine the current leadership”;
  Universal values of human rights - an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of party leadership.
  Civil Society - a “political tool” of the “Western anti-China forces” dismantle the ruling party’s social foundation.
  Neoliberalism - US-led efforts to “change China’s basic economic system”.
  The West’s idea of journalism - attacking the Marxist view of news, attempting to “gouge an opening through which to infiltrate our ideology”.
  Historical nihilism - trying to undermine party history, “denying the inevitability” of Chinese socialism.
  Questioning Reform and Opening - No more arguing about whether reform needs to go further.
  * The biggest challenge to Western liberal and democratic ideals is that
  propaganda constantly leaks out of China. TikTok / Twitter / FB / WeChat,
  China will find a way to connect with its global diaspora and then, the rest
  of those who can be politically useful against the constant threat of Western
  thought. The Chinese model of authoritarianism has already implanted itself as
  somewhat attractive because of "how they've handled the COVID situation". It's
  absurd to assume that Western countries can choose piecemeal the pieces of
  Chinese authoritarian governance to apply and expect it to work out well
  (Ben and James covered this in [ep 184 of
  Exponent](https://t.co/fxlBWIMEjC?amp=1)).
  * My thoughts: Read the comments. I like Tom Clissold's and Justin O'Connor's.

__Life Updates__:
* I decided to risk my life (joking) and go on a [mountain
trip](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1280262884082106368) with my
paragliding instructor, Jeff Greenbaum, and the Mussel Rock locals for July 4th
weekend. It was absolutely worth it because now I know the gang and have a
guarantee that people will watch and help me when I go to [fly at
Cheetah](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1281461779155939328). The budding
relationship I have with the Mussel Rock locals is one big reason I wouldn't
want to leave the Bay Area.
* I've also restarted my Duolingo Russian learning. I'm far too lazy to learn on
my own, so I figure I'll mentally exhaust myself each evening by running through
around 130-150XP of lessons.
* "We're here to have a good time, not here for a long time!!" <<- Said in
response to someone else's crabby remarks about a camping set up.
* I've realized that I get very very upset when I'm bored. The days where I'm
bored at work are the days where I think work sucks. The days when I can't
figure out how to engage my mind are the days I feel like I wasted. I don't
think I've ever been good at managing my response to boredom, but the Internet
has definitely filed away at my patience and ability to just sit still and be
grateful to be alive and to have a functioning cognition.
