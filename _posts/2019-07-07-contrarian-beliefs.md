I finally have some answers to Peter Thiel's question:
**What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

1. [Bad eyesight, especially myopia is naturally reversible](https://xrdt.github.io/cliffgnu-vision.pdf).
2. [Diabetes can be reversed by inducing ketosis](https://www.virtahealth.com/reversediabetes).
3. Bodybuilders are some of the greatest nutritionists.
