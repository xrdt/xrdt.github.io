I finally have some answers to Peter Thiel's question:
**What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

1. [Bad eyesight, especially myopia is naturally
   reversible](https://xrdt.github.io/cliffgnu-vision.pdf).
2. [Diabetes can be reversed by inducing
   ketosis](https://www.virtahealth.com/reversediabetes).
3. [Saturated fat is not
   dangerous](https://fireinabottle.net/the-ros-theory-of-obesity/)
4. If pharma companies were honest, their goals would be to put themselves out
   of business.
5. Capitalism encourages companies to act as economic perpetual motion machines.
6. People or organizations who insist on formatting standards should provide
   automatic formatters.
