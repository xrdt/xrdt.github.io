Order of notes do not necessarily map to chronological order of relevant mention
in [the podcast](https://exponent.fm/episode-184-good-is-better-than-perfect/).


* Taiwan reacted in a way that demonstrated a stronger grasp of systems thinking
than the West has.
  * The Taiwanese government immediately stimulated a response to produce more
  masks and limit the export of masks (China was buying up tons of masks all
  over world for its populace).
* The US government's lying about masks eroded the authority of and public trust
in the CDC and other political entities.
  * The misguided response was based on an assumption that the United
  States as a system is in a static manufacturing shortage with regards to masks
  and other medical equipment. This demonstrates a lack of systems thinking
  among American leadership.
* Why is it important to mandate that *everyone*, not just the sick wear masks?
  * If only the sick (or the paranoid) wear masks, it becomes a marker of
  illness. You want to avoid the societal panic and harassment that will ensue
  from people displaying markers of their illness (I'm thinking about leprosy).
  * It's also kind of obvious that only masks or social isolation can prevent
  transmission of a disease that spreads through droplets.
* We have no better tactic than mass quarantine to deal with a disease that can
be asymptomatically spread.
* When faced with lying authorities, the West's best weapon is free
transmission of free speech.
  * Yes, you may have some bozos posting completely inaccurate information, but
  as [Ezra and
  Rutger](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/e/62717474)
  discussed, if you haven't been scammed before, your default level of trust in
  other people is too low. We should default to a trust in the power of free
  speech and dynamic public debate and experimentation. More iterations means
  faster learning. Twitter is the West's main informational tool against COVID
  misinformation.
  * Yes, the Internet changes the risk profile on validity of information, but
  the benefits to free speech outweigh the drawbacks of censorship and
  information hiding and the occasional crackpots.
    * The world is still stuck in a mode of elite reverence for the fixed,
    printed word. Think books. The printed word cannot be easily modified. Any
    edition must be perfect because there will not be another printing for a
    long time. The authorities are largely still operating in this mode where
    they assume they need to get things right the first and only time, rather
    than understanding how the Internet allows for rapid iterations and
    corrections, each of which will be accepted as part of the dynamic nature of
    information spread and evolution of understanding.
* The WHO is basically a Chinese political entity. Never underestimate the
importance of geopolitics.
  * We expect the WHO to be an independent entity but we need to wake up to the
  geopolitical realities governing the operations of the org.
* Doubt is the biggest weapon for killing credibility.
  * Effective crisis communication requires honesty and hope.
* People are starting to believe that because China demonstrated an "exemplary
response" to the COVID situation, Chinese authoritarianism may not be such a
bad alternative to Western liberalism. Ben and James push back on this with
their definition of strategy: "a collected set of options that make sense
together". You can't take authoritarianism piecemeal and apply it to the US and
expect wonderful results. The rest of society must follow along.
