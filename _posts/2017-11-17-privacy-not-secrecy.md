If you have nothing to hide, you have no need for privacy. This statement is absolutely absurd. There is a difference between secrecy and privacy. Just because there is no secret about what I do when I go use a changing room in a department store doesn’t mean I want there to be no doors. Secrecy brings with it feelings of shame and fear because we know that the truth is harmful. But privacy is merely the concept of being unobserved. To know something private is not harmful. In fact, knowing something private can be insightful and bonding. Revealing private thoughts can be cathartic.

The need for digital privacy operates on the same principles. It is insightful to know my search history because it reveals my preferences, but I don’t need everybody else to have that data. I want things kept within reasonable boundaries.
