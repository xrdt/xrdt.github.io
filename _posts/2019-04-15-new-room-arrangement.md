I recently rearranged the furniture in my room so my desk would face out my
window. (Thank goodness Caltech has not heeded Munger's advice regarding
["window fetishes"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2014/10/01/charlie-munger-and-the-2014-daily-journal-annual-meeting-part-three/#6c8e93bf71d7).)
I contemplated this move when I first moved into the room but I didn't execute
it until about four furniture rearrangements later. The main disadvantage of
this setup is that my back is to the door. This is not the ideal setup
because sitting with your back to the door exposes you to potential threats.
It probably also raises my cortisol levels because I'm now spending more
effort trying to listen for people moving around or through my door. Other
than that, I think the benefit of looking out the window and being able to
rest my myopic eyes outweighs the stress of having my back to the door.
Besides, I can always just shut my door.
