Six factors of burn-out:
* lack of control
* insufficient reward
* lack of community
* absence of fairness
* conflict in values
* work overload

I found this list recently on a [HackerNews post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20331654) on ...
obviously, burnout. It's the first list I've seen, in all the times I've spent looking for discussions on
why burnout happens and how to fix it (too many times) that feels satisfactorily comprehensive. This list comes out of
the [Burnout Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslach_Burnout_Inventory) Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson
published in 1981. The inventory lays out a rubric for evaluating a patient's degree of burnout. The following are the
symptoms of occupational burnout from the Inventory:
* Emotional Exhaustion (EE)
* Depersonalization (DP)
* Personal Accomplishment (PA)
* Cynicism
* Professional Efficacy
The more frequently you experience the above symptoms, the worse your burnout is.

I couldn't find any definitive research from Maslach on [recovery](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159X.2016.1248918) from
[burnout](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/graduate-medical-education/assets/reversing-burnout-how-to-rekindle-your-passion-for-your-work.pdf).
The recommendations in those two publications appear common sense. I suppose we have not found any better way to deal with issues of the
heart / soul / mind than to ask for compassion, cooperation, and accommodation from the relevant community. Of course, these issues also require
an adjustment in the sufferer's expectations about how they want to play the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)
and what they can get out of it. It appears that spiritual [texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts) and
[practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) tend to be the most [commonly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) prescribed tools for
facilitating the personal adjustment. I would suggest adding nutritional and physical remedies to the burnout recovery toolbox. For example:
* Eating a more natural diet. [Ivor Cummins](https://thefatemperor.com) has some great resources for understanding the biochemistry behind
nutrition.
* Realigning your body. [Katy Bowman](https://www.nutritiousmovement.com) is my go to for all alignment and healthy movement knowledge. Feeling
physically comfortable and strong will help you tackle the day with more vigor and effectiveness.

I once spent a couple of months working through spiritual texts like [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance),
[The Wisdom of Insecurity](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Age-Anxiety/dp/0307741206), and [Finite and Infinite Games](https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713).
Those books briefly made me feel secure and wise. I quickly lost the comfort of a spiritual master's lofty vision of the world and became once again
entrenched in the stresses of school and work and financial gains and losses. I later [took a class](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/maura-d-dykstra) that discussed Buddhism
and again came to the conclusion that if I was to believe the text, there was nothing left to be done but sit back and watch the world
[unfold](https://invertedpassion.com/why-are-we-rich-but-hopeless/). I suppose I don't believe the texts enough, because I'm still thinking about
whether I want to be one who makes history or one who reviews and interprets and retells history. I do believe there will soon come a day when I
transcend the modern obsession with lifestyles that seem to actively damage our physical, mental, and spiritual health. I look forward to
receiving any suggestions on texts, tools, or communities that will help me find that place where I can look upon the world and all that humans have
accomplished and feel secure in my position among the particles of the universe.
