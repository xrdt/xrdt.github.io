I distinctly remember a moment in 2017, when I was in San Francisco, that
I felt the visceral pull of disgust for a person speaking next to me. We knew
each other. In fact, we'd both just come out of the same building; we were there
for the same reason; and we were in the midst of figuring out what to do between
that moment and our flights back to Pasadena. She wasn't talking to me. She
wasn't talking to me. She wasn't even looking at me. She was talking to someone
else who'd just come out of the building we came out of, someone else who had
also been there for the same reason as us.

All of us standing on this bleak, freezing cold sidewalk on Market St in June
2017 had just come out of an interview prep program for college women. (Funnily
enough, there was a single guy mixed into the group. Him being there didn't
lessen the experience, but it was weird, in the same way it was weird to see
male attendees at Grace Hopper.) This person I would soon feel disgust for was
talking to someone else from the program, someone that she seemed to know from
high school? science fair? previous internship? They were talking about their
last internships and what they were planning on doing this summer. Now my memory
is going hazy. I can't remember exactly the words that triggered disgust in me,
but it involved something about the girl not being sure what she wanted to do.
She'd come into university wanting to do computer science and got an internship
at Google last summer. Now she wanted to do [\*\*\*] or something that wasn't
purely applying pressure to a bunch of chiclets on a circuit board connected to
a screen and making electrons do their paces on a CPU for her. Perhaps it was
jealousy of her CS experience that triggered the disgust. Perhaps it was the
feeling that her predicament was something I was stuck in the middle of as well.
Perhaps I was disdaining her choice of [\*\*\*], since I saw no way that
pursuing such an academic discipline could lead to making the big bucks, which
is of course all that matters. All these factors matter, especially the last
one, but something else that matters is the fact that I was extremely disgusted
by expression of personal uncertainties.

It pissed me off when people would say "Agh, I don't know what class to take.
Should I do ME123 or CS123...or maybe EN205 is better...but the units don't add
up, and I really like Russian history...". It pissed me off when people would
say "Should I go to that party or not...what if none of my friends are there?
And there's that final tomorrow...". Sure, these are petty examples and I'm sure
you can imagine that half-whining voice that belies that they've already made up
their mind and are just waffling...buying time for ... nothing, really. It
manifests, too, when people are trying to decide between job offers. I subjected
many mentors to the same torture in university, repeatedly listing out the
merits and demerits of each opportunity, going back and forth so so so many
times, until I came to a [conclusion that I could rationally
justify](../../2019/04/27/how-i-chose-among-job-offers-fall-2018.md). I think
that process only worked out that one time I wrote about. The other times, I
succumbed to my lack of conviction and vision and chose paths that I still
have twinges of regret over.

Why was I (am I still) so bothered by wishy washy "whining"? Part of the pain
of listening to someone talk like that was that I wasn't on the same wavelength
as them. I wasn't in their position. I didn't care (yes, call me low empathy all
you want). I knew that even if I offered rational analyses ("If you take class
A and class B, you will end up killing yourself with the work." "Is this class
even useful? Is the professor any good? What is the homework / project / test
breakdown?"), they had either already made their decision or had some idea
of the tiebreaker they would use. My sitting there, doing unpaid therapist work,
never felt productive. It didn't seem like the kind of problem solving technique
that successful people would use. It was a mode of development I was trying to
wean myself off of, and watching [people engage in actions of the level just
below mine](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/04/14/the-gervais-principle-iii-the-curse-of-development/)
was decidedly cringeworthy.

What's the ideal mode I wanted to get to? I wanted to see people with conviction,
with vision, who wouldn't voice problems in such a noncommittal way. I wanted
people to say, with confidence and resolution, "Here are the four classes I
am choosing between. What can you tell me about any of them?" I wanted them to
show that they were taking the issue seriously, that they had some framework on
which they could lay my advice and see the structure of the universe. No
flakiness, no maybe I'll do this or that or maybe even this, no my decisions
depend on the group decisions and I shan't step beyond these communal decision
making boundaries. But of course this is oversimplifying. Because sometimes
punting on the decision or not doing a detailed matrix OODA differential
geometry analysis is sufficient. If that's the case, take a strong stance on
the approach you're taking; present it clearly; be professional about each of
your actions.

I've rambled for far too long on this largely meaningless topic of nearly 3 years
cask-aged quality, so let me bring back some sense and concreteness into this
highly reflective, wishy-washy discussion about what I used to be unable to
stomach about wishy washy behavior. I recently shoved my brain through this
narrow pipe of [David Chapman's summary of Robert Kegan's model of adult
development](https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/).
It was not an altogether unpleasant journey. What was more unpleasant was
*finally* working through [Venkatesh Rao's Gervais
Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/) series and thinking
to myself, at the end, what substrate did I just pour my brain cells onto and
how am I supposed to reconcile what's growing out of that substrate with the time
I put in and what I already know about the world? What I've come to appreciate
from both those pieces is how the upper levels of existence operate on the level
of systems manipulation. That's pretty much the definition of Kegan's Level 5
and what Sociopaths spend their time doing. Sociopaths can get stuck in
some kind of Level 4.5, where they descend into and potentially never extricate
themselves from the quicksand of nihilism, but those that recover are Level 5.
I imagine people are Level 5 as having transcended frustrations like "oh I have
so many errands to do" or "oh I totally forgot to put that on my calendar, can we
reschedule" (is that just code for I'm trying to brush you off but don't want to
say so directly) or "adulting is so hard" or "haha, I'm such a ditz, I can never
remember where I put anything in the house" or the issues that Betty Draper faces
as a result of her arrested development. The problems people at Level 5 face are
much larger, with much more consequences, because Level 5 people deal with the
operating of the entire machine that runs our lives...and that's [why they get
paid so much (jk)](https://www.epsilontheory.com/shot-and-chaser/).

I'm not sure this last paragraph explained much. On the one hand, I'm railing
against the pettiness of "the Millennial inability to adult". On the other hand,
I'm saying that I don't want to see the "weakness" of watching people grapple
with uncertainty. I'm less trigger-crazy these days (you'd hope I'd have matured
from my college sophomore years), but I can feel the ire rise when a discussion
that resolves around an uncertainty starts drifting into wishy washy ["writing
about music is like dancing about the
architecture"](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/11/08/writing-about-music/)
mode. Once we've hit a point where the uncertainty is clear, it's time to break
off into work mode and build out comps or prototypes that reflect concrete
iterations of thought on how to best resolve that uncertainty. I guess what I'm
saying is, be uncertain until the uncertainty itself is clear. Then get to work
and resolve the uncertainty and discuss until uncertainty reemerges and the
new uncertainty is clear. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes you won't be able figure
out where the uncertainty is, which means you either need to get some hands on
work done or you need to try to learn vicariously. Since all advice is
autobiographical, the vicarious approach can be dangerous and require you to
assemble a large enough sample size for pattern matching to kick in. If pattern
matching doesn't kick in, and you still don't have a good answer, the default
answer is probably the right approach. Taking into account switching costs,
the expected value of a close call is likely in favor of doing nothing.

Have conviction!
