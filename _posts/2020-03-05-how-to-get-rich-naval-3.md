We left off last time on the discussion modern forms of leverage: products with 0 marginal
cost, i.e. code and media.

This time, we expand on the consideration of 0 marginal (distribution) cost and discuss economies of scale.

__Scale Economics__:<br>
You want to be in a business with decreasing marginal costs of production. That is a barrier against competition and
getting commoditized. Software products take this to the extreme with zero marginal costs of production / distribution.
It costs you no more to deliver your 1000th download than your 100th. Most of the cost is upfront. The maintenance
costs should be negligible or easily controllable.

Network effects are a great thing to have in your business because it almost guarantees a winner-take-all monopoly
result. Naively network effects increase in an squared fashion to the number of people in the network. Network effects
are so powerful that most of the winning businesses in Silicon Valley are based upon network effects. Facebook, Uber,
Google, Twitter, YouTube, Amazon. #2 in any of those categories is at best an afterthought when people are looking for a
solution to the immediate need any of the companies addresses.

One way to understand network effects is to look at languages. The value of a language increases with the number of people
using it. English is a language that has somehow accumulated lots of network effects. Chinese, due to China's classic
lack of interaction with the world, is another language with big network effects. Money is another system with big network
effects. Consider that even though most countries have their own currency, a lot of them are pegged to the US dollar or have
the dollar as the reserve.

Networks effects and low marginal costs of reproduction and scale economies are important because they mean you can
live the [4-hour workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357). Low marginal
costs of reproduction (which is a consequence of scale economies) ameans you can set up an almost failproof automated
delivery system (failproof up until you hit [server
overload](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-trading-app-returns-only-to-crash-again-on-tuesday-51583249601).
Network effects means you have delegated value production to your users. The mere fact of them being in the same place and
interacting through some conduit you have provided makes your platform worth something.

__Judgement__:<br>
Leverage is meaningless without good judgement. In fact, after you acquire leverage, you probably want to slow down and
figure out what direction you will be going in. Leverage means your inputs are amplified, but it also means it's harder to
make adjustments once you've submitted your inputs.

One reason CEOs and people like Buffet get paid so much is because they have demonstrated superior judgement. If a CEO
makes the right decision 10% more often than some other CEO, he will have made or saved the company he leads millions if not
billions of dollars, sums which dwarf his pay. People who have demonstrated incredible judgement and the integrity to be
trusted to judge on behalf of others ([agency problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principalâ€“agent_problem)) will be given
resources and simply left alone to work their magic and produce results.

Define judgement: "knowing the long term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on [them]."

Judgement is a combination of intellect and experience. Intellect alone gets you [Intellectual yet
idiots](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577). Experience alone can take you pretty far, but you'll move
faster with a better brain. As mentioned before, intellect will eventually fail you because there are some things that you can't
learn except through pattern matching and massive amounts of repeated iteration (don't hate on the AIs for needing data man, you do, too).

Experiential and pattern based learning can also be done vicariously. There's a reason great businesspeople and investors are big on
reading history and philosophy. These books give you a wide base off which to see, understand, and interpret the world. They also probably
have an effect of making you less emotional by giving you templates you can match what you're seeing against.

Turns out that most of the people with the best judgement are the least emotional. Emotion clouds your thinking and makes it so that
you probably won't acknowledge and decide to act on something until it's so prominent that you're forced to discard your emotions
and deal with it.

__Aspirational Hourly Rate__:<br>
In the end, all you have is time. You are the only person who can value your time appropriately. Put a number to it! Naval's aspirational
hourly rate was $5,000/hr. Whatever yours is, if you encounter a task that is less than your hourly rate, do it! Your time will produce
more rewards for you if you work on what will make your rich rather running some errand across town or cleaning your house or fighting with
the electrician about a $10 markup on the bill. __Caveat__: this strategy should only be pursued by those whose __single__ priority is
getting rich, building massive wealth. No need to make excuses for something you haven't prioritized.

__Working Hard, Working Right__:<br>
You should work as hard as possible on your __single__ priority. But don't forget to choose the right thing to work on and the right people
to work on it with. Remember the three criteria for choosing people from a previous post: high energy, high integrity, high intelligence.
Choosing the right thing to work on comes down to you doing something that comes naturally to you (you enjoy it, seems like work to other
people). Details about timing and seeing whether the market can bear what you want to bring to it is a topic that
[other](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/)
[people](https://podcastnotes.org/tim-ferris-show/mike-maples-andy-rachleff-tim-ferriss-product-market-fit/) have written or talked
extensively about.

Don't worry about working 80-hour, 120-hour stretches. Work in sprints. Work as hard as you can when you feel inspiration, then take a
break. Mull around and try to ingest good material and catch up on more menial tasks in between sprints. But *do not hesitate* to act when
you feel inspiration hit, because inspiration is fragile and you'll probably never get back to what you were inspired to do 5 minutes ago.
Action bias, but be patient with the results. Remember that you're acting in a complex system that is subject to
[reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)). Things may not turn out the way you want or expect them to.

Work hard to protect your time from meetings. Meetings tend to be a very effective way to waste sum_i $hourly_rate_i * hours  dollars but
not a very effective way to get work done. Unless someone has something life or death, real proof work to show you, you should be prioritizing
your working, idea fermentation, practice and reflection time. Of course, this assumes you actually have something important to do...if you don't
have something in the Type3 / Type4 category of luck where you're either building superior judgement or superior skill, taking meetings and networking
may be the highest value Type 1 / Type 2 blind luck / fortune favors the bold activity you can be doing. Or you could just sit at home and read a
bunch and think hard about the world and what you can bring to it at scale. Your time is yours to spend. These are merely suggestions for how you,
as a wealth building person, can make better use of it.

__Authenticity__:<br>
Keep refining what you do until you are the best at it. People who are world-class at what they do literally become themselves. Oprah is good at
[being Oprah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ps2nfkAiA&feature=youtu.be). Joe Rogan is good at being Joe Rogan. Elon Musk is good at being
Elon Musk. You are not going to become the next Usain Bolt. You not going to become the next Bill Gates. You are going to become the next you.
Get to work refining your statement of what you can authentically bring to the world.

You *need* to be authentic and yourself to escape [mimetic traps](https://danwang.co/college-girardian-terror/), which is just a fancy way of talking
about those pesky zero-sum [status games](https://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic/) this show [opened
with](../../02/27/how-to-get-rich-naval.html). Once you become authentic, you realize your uniqueness, and you escape competition. Refine your
authenticity until you find product-market fit. Too much competition (airlines, cereals) can indicate an industry where any savings flow through to
the customers (Charlie Munger made this statement once...help me find it.) Too little competition could mean you've become authentic to the point where
you are a market of one. Don't be afraid to take hints from people around you. Sometimes they'll recognize talents that your brain has
[processed away](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.schres.2017.11.032).

As hard as it may seem to believe, most really successful people end up doing what they love, or at least like, for a living. People are multivariate,
so maybe they only get paid for a subset of their hobbies. But all these rich people seem to be me to be pretty happy going to work every day.

Naval failed at authenticity with [Epinions](https://www.google.com/search?q=epinions). They got caught up in doing price comparison instead of going
more authentic and being the place for online reviews of esoteric, local things that people really wanted reviews for but couldn't find. Now that
space has been taken over by Amazon (through it's dominations of online retail), Tripadvisor, and Yelp.

__In the End, Everything Will Work Out__:<br>
Nivi: Your eventual [10, 20, 30 years?] outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge; times how much leverage
you can apply to that knowledge; times how often your judgment is correct; times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome; times how
much society values what youâ€™re doing. Then you compound that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through
reading and learning.

Remember that you only have to be massively right once. It's pretty hard to completely wipe yourself out, so you'll get a lot of chances at bat to figure
out how you as individual become valuable to this world.

Naval: Product-market fit is inevitable if youâ€™re doing something you love and the market wants it.

__Advice is Autobiographical__:<br>
One way to use advice is as mental hooks. Since advice is autobiographical, you'll be able to pull out the stories and tidbits that people shared with you
when you experience what caused them to come up with those pieces of "wisdom". Advice is a way for you to compress knowledge and make it easily retrievable
through the salience of stories.

__Transcending Wealth__:<br>
Money only solves your money problems. Rich people are pretty much the same people they were when they weren't rich.

Naval: your health, your mental health and your close relationshipsâ€”are things you have to cultivate. They can bring you a lot more peace and happiness
than any amount of money ever will.

Money brings you freedom. The rest you have to figure out. But once you have money, there's no reason for you to *not* have figured out everything else.
What is there blocking you devoting all your resources to becoming an ideal person?

Naval: To me the ultimate purpose of money is so you donâ€™t have to be in a specific place, at a specific time, doing anything you donâ€™t want to do.

__Con Men and Get Rich Quick Schemes__:<br>
Naval: At some level every founder has to lie to every employee of the company they have. They have to convince them, "Itâ€™s better for you to work for me
than to do what I did and go work for yourself."

Naval: You donâ€™t want to learn how to be rich from somebody who makes their money by telling people how to be rich. Itâ€™s suspect.

A good person to learn from: [Felix Dennis](https://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Rich-Greatest-Entrepreneurs/dp/1591842719).

__Final Tweet__:<br>
Naval's take on "Find three hobbies: One that makes you money, one that keeps you fit, and one that makes you creative." --> One that makes you money,
one that makes you fit, and one that makes you smarter.

Thanks for reading up until this point. The next and final post in this series on getting rich the Naval and Nivi way will go over the more ad hoc Q&A
portion of the podcast. Until next time, you can spam my [email](mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog).
