It was fall of 2011. I was a freshman in high school. It was girl's tennis
season. One of the player's birthday was coming up. Her birthday was on a day
that we had practice, but it was also the day of some school dance. She was
debating whether or not she wanted to go do the dance that entire day. Her
sister was also on the team so I guess it was her family who decided to have the
whole team join for a birthday celebration near the courts we practiced at.
There were some shenanigans immediately after practice about whether the
birthday girl should go to the dance...I believe her sister eventually took
her to the clubhouse bathroom to get changed and tidied up. The rest of us
quickly split into cars and drove to the Red Lobster just up the street. I was
in her mom's car. Somehow, we ended up driving right in front of the birthday
girl and her sister's car. Her mom was so worried the birthday girl would see
that we were in front of them and become suspicious...(The birthday girl is
apparently quite perceptive...while still a toddler, she noticed the horses at
a horse race while her sister didn't even register the animals. *shrug*).

We all made it to Red Lobster without being noticed. I think most people ordered
the unlimited shrimp festival special. I ordered some kind of shrimp scampi and
linguine plate. Her dad ordered some combination of desserts and then we went to
see Moneyball at the seedy dive theater across the street. I believe they were
deciding between Moneyball (baseball) and Thor (action), neither of which I
thought were particularly good, but what did a culturally lacking 9th grader
like me know at the time? I think they settled on Moneyball because Brad Pitt.

The movie turned out to be excellent. I think it's high time to go rewatch it...
but it's not on Netflix...curses.
