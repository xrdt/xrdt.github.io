[This book](https://www.amazon.com/Chop-Wood-Carry-Water-Becoming/dp/1483441784F)
is motivational fiction. It follows a series of stories between
a guy who moves to Japan to train for 10 years to become a samurai archer and
his archer sensei. The main pieces I took away from this, which aren't
anything new but go so against the conventional hubbub and IG / Twitter /
whatever the f\*\* social media you like to ingest in gallons these days
"I live a high leverage, highly successful life" that it's helpful to dive
into a book like this and emerge refreshed, are below:
  * The only thing you have to do in life is *die*. You may not like the
  choices in front of you, but they are still choices.
  * You are always [building your own house](https://www.facebook.com/LifeWithGreysonParker/posts/i-want-to-share-with-you-an-excerpt-from-a-book-chop-wood-carry-water-by-joshua-/1537385009622840/).
  * Focus on the process not the goal. Focusing on goals over living in the
  present and treating each experience, each opportunity, each day as a way to
  grow will only lead to dissastisfaction and reduced performance.
  * Discouragement is the most pernicious evil. Once it sets root in your
  brain, it raises the activation energy on just about everything you want to
  do and prevents you from digging yourself out of the hole you're in.
  * Focus on who you are, not what you do. Human _being_, not human _doing_.
  Who would you be if everything you do was taken away from you?
  * Live by principles, not feelings. Feelings are fickle; principles are
  enduring.
  * Going up the rough side of the mountain, suffering, blisters, soreness,
  these are character building and necessary teachers that help make sure you
  won't lose sight of what it takes to maintain your position in life. Never
  forget the importance of a solid foundation.
  * There is nothing magical about success. It's a daily process of chopping
  wood, carrying water, or [making 800 shots every morning from 4am to
  11am](https://www.stack.com/a/kobe-bryant-workouts). Since there are no
  shortcuts, or as the book says:
  > "But what if I devote every waking moment to becoming a samurai archer?
  No chopping wood or carrying water, just archery."
  > But Akira only shrugged. "Then, it will take thirty years."
  You may as well learn to love every moment you get to spend honing your
  craft.
  * If you want to supercharge your life, try finding a mission. A mission is
  a north star that no one can stop you from working towards.
    * The author's is: "to live my life in a way that I can get diagnosed with
    cancer and have it not change a thing a in my life".
    * Another example: "To become love so that everywhere we go people will want
    that love."
    * Another example: "To become love so that everywhere we go people will want
    that love".
