The fundamental criterion for having a good life is to want to be alive.

Thus, if you want to live a good life, you must find those things which make
you want to be alive.

Every action is accompanied by a motivation. Your life also needs a
motivation. The journey to find that motivation will likely be miserable, but
a life without that motivation will be even more unfortunate. It is better
to earnestly try and never succeed than to declare defeat before trying.

The human mind thrives when it is being challenged. Try to find something
which you can dedicate yourself to. You need to find a whetstone against
which you can slowly but surely train yourself (磨練）. Don't worry about
feeling like a failure or actually failing. These obstacles are necessary
teachers in your journey to awakening and a purposeful life.
