Economics, I’m telling you, all they talk about is rationality<br>
Having multiple optionality isn’t computational insanity<br>
Because we all living in hyper-reality<br>
Our brains as good as cyborgs, this is the new age of humanity<br>
Let’s take it to the next level, grow our minds, bodies, and cities<br>
Deny the self to achieve exponential monies con diddy<br>
