Good Lord the [brilliance

[Sana Biotech](https://sana.com). Basically the pharma version of Synthego.
That means it could actually make tons of money (according to Ann). Services
companies, like Synthego, can't make money because Quality Control costs are
too high to get something approved for lab use. They just raised [$700

  * Really spooky 1998 Japanese miniseries.

__Books__:<br> [No Rules
Rules](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860).
Absolutely fantastic book; blew my expectations out of the water. This is
without a doubt a time when making an exception to the Lindy Rule has proven
extraordinarily fruitful.
  * The [OG(?) Netflix culture
   deck](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664).
  * Netflix views the company, not as a family, but as a high performing team.
    This is how sports teams run, except that most Netflix employees don't have
    explicit contract end-dates built in. Each person is on the team because he
    is the best person for this role at this time. How do you build such a high
    performing team and make sure they can do their best work?
    * Increase talent density
      * "Best perk of any job -- stunning colleagues. Every other perk you can
        buy." -- Abhishek Rai.
      * Well, technically, you *can* buy stunning colleagues. That's what
        Netflix does. They pay top of market and continually reindex someone's
        pay to just over 100th percentile of their level. They encourage
        employees to take interviews and return that feedback to their leaders
        so their pay can be updated or at least stored in Netflix's internal
        database.
      * One bad apple draws the entire team's performance down to its level.
        It's also clear that there are 10x performers in creative fields like
        computer science. It pays to assemble as many heavy hitters as you can
        and ensure that they stay as long as they are the best talent you can
        find.
      * How do you evaluate whether it's time for an employee to move on? Use
        the "Keeper Test" : "Which of my people, if they told me they were
        leaving, for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to
        keep at Netflix?" Anybody who you feel lukewarm about (and hopefully
        you don't feel worse about them because you should have removed them
        sooner) should be given a generous severance package and best wishes
        for the next phase of their career.
        * The 10x phenomenon only applies to creative fields. Operational
          fields like assembly line manufacturing or window washing have a
          lower cap on max performance above the average and should not be
          compensated in this extraordinary way.
        * Also, bonuses don't work. They stress people working on creative or
          otherwise brain engaging tasks and result in worse performance. Also,
          people come to expect the bonus as part of their annual salary,
          removing the (extra addictive) variable reward.
    * Increase [(Radical)

      * How to give feedback well 2 of 4As:
        * Aim to Assist
        * Actionable
      * How to receive feedback well 2 of 4As:
        * Appreciate
        * Accept or Discard
      * Formal mechanisms for soliciting feedback:
        * Company-wide written 360s
          * Employees specify people they want to receive feedback from.
            Feedback is given in response to the prompts: "Start, Stop,
            Continue" to encourage specific and actionable notes.
        * Live 360s
          * This is most likely done on a team by team basis, and probably over
            dinner or in some other setting people can feel comfortable in for
            a few hours. Each person in the group will receive "Start, Stop,
            Continue" feedback. The manager's responsibility is to ensure that
            the content of the feedback is appropriate (no slurs, direct
            attacks, overly aggressive tone, etc) and to set the tone for the
            night by choosing people to start the session.
      * More feedback, shorter iterations = more learning ---> compounds into
        --> fantastically large long-term gains.
      * Consider cultural differences regarding preference for direct vs
        indirect feedback.
        * There are great people all around the world. Accommodating cultural
          differnces in how people prefer to receive feedback and how people
          prefer to interact with coworkers will help you unlock the stored
          energy of all these international superstars.
    * Remove Controls and Processes
      * "Don't seek to please your boss".
      * Caveat, these principles work best in creative industries, where risk
        taking is a necessary feature of the innovation that defines the
        "creative" moniker. In industries, like medical device manufacturing,
        where the cost of error and / or trial is high, it's best to stick to
        the traditional hierarchical management structure.
      * Provide the right context ("Act in Netflix's Best Interest") in which
        decisions should be made and trust that the smart people you hired can
        apply sound judgement.
        * If someone makes an egregious mistake (this can be discovered through
          meticuluous event by event auditing or by randomized auditing) which
          clearly violates the trust you placed in them, expel them from the
          company in a public and clearly explained way so others are well
          aware of the boundaries and the consequences.
        * No need to curtail the experience of the many for the inanity or lack
          of fit of the few.
      * Give your people the data and the tools necessary to understand the
        business they are building. Help them have skin in the game and all the
        information they need to make smart decisions for themselves. Opt
        towards openness, except when you need to protect personal privacy.
      * Empower individuals to take charge of their own decisions. The
        following 4-step cycle guides Netflix's bottom-up driven innovation
        efforts:
        * "Farm for dissent" or "socialize" the idea. See what other people
          think.
        * Test out the idea in a playground or sandbox.
        * As the [informed
         captain](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7u3cza/has_anyone_worked_at_a_biotech_company/dtixabp),
          take the bet.
          * You own the contract. You own the project. Not your boss. Not your
            boss's boss. Own that skin in the game and responsiblity you're
            hard pressed to find elsewhere and pull the trigger when you're
            ready.  You're the domain level expert, so it only makes sense to
            grant you much deserved ownership.
        * If it succeeds, celebrate. If it fails, sunshine it. How do you
          sunshine?
          * Ask what learning came from the project.
          * Don't make a big deal out of it.
          * Shine that bright sunshine on the failure so others can also learn
            from it.
      * Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled
        * Set a clear north star and then set people free to take responsiblity
          for and exercise ownership over their domains. Lead with context, not
            control. If people make mistakes, consider what context you failed
            to set.

[Krishnamurti on Education and the Significance of
Life](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Significance-Life-Krishnamurti/dp/0060648767)
  * This is a man to read when you feel spiritually depleted. Below I've listed
    a few quotes from the book. Krishnamurti never deviates in his main
    message, and there really isn't much more to the book besides the main
    message, but the book never feels repetitive. It's remarkable, the way this
    man can admonish and sooth at the same time.

__Business Strategy__:<br> [Stratechery: What do to about regulating Big Tech
(FAGA)?](https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/)
  * What exactly is there to investigate in each of these companies?
    * Do they actually have a monopoly?
      * [FTC definition of
        monopoly](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/monopolization-defined):
        "a 'monopolist' is a firm with significant and durable market power.
        Courts look at the firm’s market share, but typically do not find
        monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has
        less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service
        within a certain geographic area. [...] if competitive forces or the
        entry of new firms could discipline the conduct of the leading firm,
        courts are unlikely to find that the firm has lasting market power"
      * Microsoft (historical example): Monopoly on OSs. Lock-in from network
        effects between developers and users.
      * Facebook:
      * Google: Is competition really a click away? [European Commission says
        that supplier / user network effects and Google's data
        collection](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1785_en.htm)
        make Google's position durable.
      * Amazon: Only 37% e-commerce sales, only single digits retail share.
      * Apple: Dominant in smartphones? Only max 45% share in any market.  But
        it is dominant in iOS app store (is this even a legitimate market
        defintion?). "Suggesting that users changing ecosystems is a sufficient
        antidote to Apple’s behavior is like suggesting that users subject to a
        hospital monopoly in their city should simply move elsewhere".
    * Are they engaging in anti-competitive behavior? Everything below this
      line is meaningless if the a sufficient argument for the previous bullet
      is not presented.
      * Microsoft (historical example): Bundling IE with Windows and
        restricting OEMs from installing other browsers. Browser bundling is
        now a moot point, since you basically can't do anything on a computer
        without a browser...  But OEM restrictions are a big problem because
        they certainly aren't done in the name of consumer welfare.
      * Facebook: [Acquisition of IG is certainly
        anticompetitive](https://stratechery.com/2017/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-buy-tbh/).
        "the best way to spur competition in the long run is to force companies
        to compete with new entrants, not buy them out"
      * Google: AMP, YouTube over other video sites in search results, Google
        Maps with its crappy results over Yelp / TripAdvisor / etc, Tweets over
        LinkedIn / FB / etc. And the [Android PlayStore
        fiasco](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-commission-versus-android/).
      * Amazon: You don't have to sell on Amazon. Also, every retailer offers
        its own branded goods.
      * Apple: Rent seeking behavior in the app store.
    * What are the remedies?
      * Microsoft (historical example): Break up! No, haha, that was overruled.
        Actually, they were agreed to open up the Windows API. But this,
        arguably, only allowed people to create interoprable tools, rather than
        opening up the possibility for Windows alternatives.
      * Facebook: Break up FB, IG, WhatsApp.
      * Google: Restrict anticompetitive behavior!! You cannot favor your own
        products.
      * Amazon: ...not sure what there is to do here since the previous bullets
        are so weak.
      * Apple: Reform the App Store! Third party payment providers, reduce take
        rate?
    * What will happen with and without regulator intervention?
      * Microsoft (historical example): Eh, nothing important. Ben thinks MSFT
        is culturally unsuited for the Internet and mobile and would have been
        taken over by Goog and Apple anyway.
      * Facebook: Prevent future anticompetitive mergers. Otherwise, you can
        revisit this question in a few years, when IG loses its dominance and
        yet another social media player comes into vogue.
      * Google: Hey, the giant still is only supporting itself on the one peg
        of search revenues. That's why it's so desperate to tilt the playing
        field it owns in its favor. It hasn't found another breakthrough (maybe
        cloud?).
      * Amazon: Eh, I suppose the company's hitting the ever expected plateau
        in the S curve.
      * Apple: iPhone growth plateaued, the company's pulling a big services
        play, the app store rake is starting to look like a pretty good revenue
        and stock price driver
  * What is driving concentration in the economy? Systemically engineered lack
    of choice? Legitimate consumer choice based on superiority of product
    offerings?
  * Growth at all costs is a dangerous doctrine that ignores the S-curve
    phenomenon that dominates pretty much all growing systems. When a company
    has strong pressures to keep growing, its behavior will mimic the anxiety
    it feels when it seems the plateau coming hard up at it and it doesn't have
    another hockey stick growth curve to attach to its existing growth curve
    and thus delay the plateau for another few years. The government should
    prevent the internal desperation from playing out in anticompetitive or
    harmful to consumer welfare ways and allow new players to bud and grow and
    start a wholly distinct S-curve of fantastic growth. Did anybody watch the

[Harry's and Credit
Karma](https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/).
  * I listened to the [Exponent Scale Scale
   Scale](https://exponent.fm/episode-182-scale-scale-scale/) episode back in
    July, but reading the article showed me how much of the Aggregation Theory
    angle I missed (it's a bit difficult to get Aggregation Theory across
    without visuals).
  * To start at the beginning, the FTC blocked Harry's acquisition because
    Harry's move into brick and mortar lowered prices! Edgewell's acquisition
    of Harry's would also increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which is a
    clear sign of increasing concentration. All reasonable points, but it
    misses why Harry's wanted to go into brick and mortar and whether Harry's
    can survive as an independent entity.
  * CPG companies integrate: R&D, Manufacturing, Shelf Space, Marketing.
  * CPG companies commoditize: Logistics, Retail, Raw Materials.
  * DTC companies integrate: Manufacturing, Retail, Marketing.
  * DTC companies commoditize: R&D (really, they view it as unnecessary),
    Logistics (and eliminate Shelf Space).
  * What's missing here? Marketing on the internet is a whole different rodeo
    from the money + scale wins game of TV and newspaper coupons advertising
    that traditional CPG companies invest in. Internet marketing is all about
    targeting and tracking, things that, it turns out, Google and FB are
    collecting the bill on. These DTC companies were shelling out massive
    amounts of money for Google and FB to do their consumer research and ad
    inventory allocation for them.
  > Facebook really is better at finding them customers than anyone else. That
  means that the best return-on-investment for acquiring customers is on
  Facebook, where DTC companies are competing against all of the other DTC
  companies and mobile game developers and incumbent CPG companies and everyone
  else for user attention.
  * Harry's had to go brick and mortar because it was too hard to compete
    against FB and Goog. It was simply cheaper to do low end disruption offline
    than online. This is a big issue because now they've closed off acquisition
    corridors (FTC argument isn't illogical) and because there's no underlying
    product reason that Harry's should be cheaper than Gillette or Schick's
    (aren't CPG price wars fun when you're the small guy?). So...what's next
    for Harry's? Change the cost structure, I suppose, to actually play the way
      the internet demands to be played. Watch out for what parts of the value
      chain are modularized and what will modularized and make sure you don't
      get squeezed.
  * And what about Credit Karma? Well, Intuit wants Credit Karma because it's
    got users. If Intuit owns those users, it doesn't need to pay FB and Goog
    anymore. It's more valuable to aggregate demand than to create supply.

[Reflections on Amazon's 2019 hardware event and FB's Oculus Connect
Conference](https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/)
  * Apple and Google weren't the only two companies who figured something out
    during the smartphone era. Amazon built AWS into the fantastic and critical
    platform it is now. FB got forced out of the platform play into being just
    an app, which helped it focus on content and advertising. But, let's not
    forget Amazon's failure of a Fire Phone and FB's failures in Facebook Home
    and Facebook One. These two failures seem to have spoken loudly through the
    company's two conferences.
  * Amazon announced 15 new hardware products, all of them significantly
    cheaper than the competition. They've clearly shifted their hardware
    focuses back to their strengths of building for ubiquity and making buying
    things that much easier and cheaper and faster. Their beachhead is the
    HOME. But remember that Google is winning the ubiquity game with Android
    and the bundled Google services (maps, assistant, calendar, etc).
  * FB consolidated Oculus into the Oculus Quest. They're clearly still angling
    for the platform play. They're looking for a beach head in VR --> AR. Will
      they get it? Can FB actually be a platform when social is really only as
      aspect of our lives and what we want our phones and other devices to do?
      Is FB not better suited to being an app? Zuckerberg below on his shock
      that apps (like FB) have largely stayed apps and not succeeded in the
      platform world.
  > We experience the world through this feeling of presence and the
  interactions that we get with other people, which is why Facebook’s
  technology vision has always been about putting people at the center of your
  computing experience. We've mostly done that so far through building apps. I
  don’t think it's an accident that a lot of the top-used and biggest apps that
  are out there are social experiences that put people at the center of the
  experience, because that’s how we process things.  <br>---<br>
  > But there is only so much you can do with apps, without also shaping and
  improving the underlying platform. I find it shocking that we’re here in 2019
  and our phones and our computers are still organized around apps and tasks
  and not people that we are actually present with. I feel like we can help all
  of us together deliver a unique contribution to this field by helping to
  ensure that the next platform changes this.

Fantastic two part series on
[Microsoft's](https://stratechery.com/2013/why-microsofts-reorganization-is-a-bad-idea/)
[2013
reorg](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-uncanny-valley-of-a-functional-organization/).
  * [Part
   1](https://stratechery.com/2013/why-microsofts-reorganization-is-a-bad-idea/)
    focuses on the distinctions between a divisional organization (old MSFT),
    where each product is effectively a subcompany, with its own P&L,
    engineering, marketing, finance, etc, and the functional organization,
    where functions are their own divisions and are shared across products.
    * In the divisional org, employees should be generalist. They should be
      able to jump around within the org and fulfill any job. GE / DuPont are
      other examples of divisional orgs.
    * In the functional org, employees should be specialists who love to do
      nothing more than get better and better at their specific function. Apple
      is a functional org.
    * Where do divisional orgs function better?
      * Multi-product companies. In a functional org, all decisions roll up to
        the CEO and thus demand a visionary product leader. It's hard to split
        your focus across more than 3 - 5 products, which is why delegation to
        independent divisions suits a multi-product company.
      * Divisional orgs have built in compensation-based performance
        incentives.
      * Clearer accountability because every division has its own P&L.
      * Generalists have clear advancement pathways. You can move laterally and
        vertically.
      > Microsoft has been hiring this type of person for years now:
      career-focused, monetarily-motivated generalists. In other words, the
      exact sort of person who does not do well in a functional organization
      that values expertise and experience.
      * Divisional orgs are competitive. Cross group collab is [famously
        difficult at MSFT](https://bonkersworld.net/organizational-charts). Oh,
        don't forget stack ranking, either.
  * [Part
   2](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-uncanny-valley-of-a-functional-organization/)
    talks about the uncanny valley and how that shape applies to many things
    where performing almost perfect is drastically worse than performing good
    enough.  Ben breaks down four ways in which functional orgs are superior to
    divisional orgs and how trying to approach the functional orgs superiority
    can land you deep in the trough of uncanniness:
  1. Collaboration.
    * Willingness + freedom to disagree X Mutual trust + respect.
      * Only high on both axes gets your real collaboration (healthy right edge
        of uncanny valley)
      * Low disagree + high respect == group think (uncanny valley)
      * High disagree + low respect == conflict (uncanny valley)
      * Low disagree + low respect == escalation / top down decision making
        (moderately good left edge of uncanny valley)
  2. Visionary leaders. In a functional org, everything eventually rolls up to
  the CEO. The CEO is the only person with the whole org vision and thus must
  set the direction for the entire ship. Here is where Tim Cook falls short of
  Steve -- he's not a product guy. Here's how the uncanny valley spectrum of
  visionary leadership breaks down.
    * Distribution vision (moderately good left edge of uncanny valley)
    * Collective train wreck due to bad or unclear or nonexistent leadership
      (uncanny valley)
    * Collective breakthrough (peak Apple and healthy right edge)
  3. Focus. TVs and Watches reducing Apple focus?
    * Delegation (good enough)
    * Blindness (uncanny valley)
    * Focus (healthy right side)
  4. Experts.
    * Generalists (good enough, divisional)
    * Sabotage / exodus (uncanny valley). When your middle managers get pushed
      to a point where they provide no value in a functional org, they will
      sabotage or up and leave en masse.
    * Experts (healthy right side).
    > The best sort of employee finds fulfillment in nothing more than the work
    they do; the more typical one eventually seeks greener pastures and/or
    burns out.
  * Why do companies eventually go for divisional structures? Because growth is
    the name of the game. You don't want to destroy still profitable but not
    growing businesses but you want to support budding new businesses with huge
    growth (or potential), so you separate them into two happy, independent
    divisions under the same parent.

  * People hedge against mortgage duration changes by shorting or buying the
    10-year US treasury. This artificially increases the volatility of the
    10-year treasury, and, by virtue of the 10-year and the US dollar being
    benchmarks for the world, increases long-term interest rates for the world.
    If US homeowners were responsible for managing their own duration risk,
    like [people in other
    countries](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/international-real-estate-financing-36651962),
    this wouldn't be quite so much of an issue.

  * What to do about it? Deflate real estate prices (by getting rid of govt.
    guarantee on GSEs [Fannie and Freddi] debt), deflate the currency
    (helicopter money), inflate everything else. Why do we care?
  1. Long-term interest rates are more volatile than they should be, and are a
  misleading indicator of economic activity and investor sentiment;
  2. Individual savers in the US are overweight residential real estate
  compared to other asset classes, so US consumption growth is strongly tied to
  real estate;
  3. The main channel by which monetary stimulus turns into higher consumer
  spending is through solvent homeowners deciding to spend more money — so when
  we cut rates, we get more of what the upper middle class likes to buy
  (healthcare, education, and more houses); and
  4. The US labor market is artificially immobile during recessions (exactly
  when mobility matters the most).
