I started out college wanting to be a business major. I thought being a
quant was an acceptable transition away from the impenetrable world of
fundamental investing strategies that investors like David Einhorn
and Joel Greenblatt and Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett inhabited and that I
had also tried to enter. I didn't
have the patience to sit down and pore over S-1's, 10-K's, 10-Q's, balance
sheets, and excel sheets with growth and value projections (spreadsheets still
make my eyes water), so I thought I could teach a computer to do it for me.
But I was a dumb freshman and figured I didn't need to learn how to code in
school,
so I tossed aside the pre-assigned CS1 course for Ec11, figuring that coding
could be picked up on the side once I mastered the dark arts of business,
economics, and management (BEM). That was a mistake, but I corrected myself
sophomore year.

(Am I rambling [again]? TL;DR: I dropped my business major just before senior
year of college because I felt it was a waste of time.)

Looking back on my
[four year course plan from 2017](../../../old_course_schedule.pdf),
I see that I tried to optimize for an ACM (Applied and Computational
Mathematics) / BEM major in the first year. Note that I manically reworked
the spreadsheet this pdf is based on every term. I thought I was being a
genius by spending a lot of time poring over my course schedule and moving
this class here and that class there so I wouldn't overload or so I would
take the slightly more interesting class in an earlier year. That exercise,
because I was so constrained by the BEM / CS double major I eventually decided
upon, was a waste of time. I regret now not dropping
BEM earlier and taking more ME / EE classes (robotics, machine shop, CNC, FPGA,
signal processing, etc).

Anyway, my first summer internship was with the
Caltech endowment office. The people there were exceptionally nice (should
I say are? It's still the same people), but I quickly realized that reading
white papers and presentations on funds and navigating the
Bloomberg terminal were not my cup of tea. This was the
summer that I started to learn to code, though. I started by teaching myself
VBA for Excel so I could automate a spreadsheet data entry workflow. VBA
was ... frustrating, but I'm not sure it was more frustrating than any other
first language I could have picked up. My life probably would have been
easier if I worked with Pandas and Python, but what did I know? I chose VBA
because it seemed like the most obvious way to automate Excel.

I also worked on replicating a paper and tracking returns for some of the
specialty funds through Bloomberg while with Caltech. The paper replication
was what I thought I wanted to do, but I didn't end up enjoying it. I also
am not sure I backtested the algorithm correctly.

Despite not finding finance my thing during that summer with the
Investment Office (let me say a few words of thanks to the investment team.
They took me, an unexperienced but stereotypically bushy-tailed freshman, in
as an intern and gave me pretty much free rein to explore finance in whatever
way I saw fit. The team and I have kept in contact since the internship,
through the Caltech Student Investment Fund and because we just like each
other. The Investment Office team is a wonderful group of people
that I would absolutely recommend you work with, whether you're a potential
donor, a fund, a student, and alum, etc. They're awesome people and will
do what they can to help you out.), I doubled down on my finance efforts in
year 2. I also decided to do the CS major, which is why that year's courses
have a bunch of "CS's" as prefixes. That summer, I decided to
go work for Fuller and Thaler, in San Mateo. I heard about them through my
BEM 104 class with Ben Gillen and thought behavioral finance could be the
niche in finance that I was looking for. Notice that I took behavioral
finance 3rd term that year. That was to prepare for my summer with Fuller and
Thaler.

My summer with Fuller and Thaler was productive. I worked with Raife and
Yining, a portfolio manager and head of risk management, respectively. I was
the firms' first technical intern, so they were at a bit of
a loss regarding how best to incorporate technology into their investment
workflow. What we ended up doing was implementing a basic sentiment analysis
engine for news. I wrote a script in Python to scrape news from Yahoo and
Google Finance and then rate the articles for their postitive / negative /
neutral sentiment. The script took a while to run, partly because I had to
use selenium to get to the bottom of Yahoo Finance's infinite scroll pages
and partly because the scraper was not written very well. I cobbled
together an asynchronous solution, but I didn't really understand
how to use the asynchronous Python libraries. Anyway, the summer was fun,
I learned how to use Python more, I learned how hard it is to have a machine
parse 10-K's and 10-Q's (the formatting is all over the place, really), and
I got to see how an investing firm runs. For those who are
curious, the firm runs in a very independent way. Each portfolio manager
pursues their own strategy. Raife is the more quantitative guy, having done a
PhD in finance with Daniel Kahneman, which is why I worked so much with him.

My time with Fuller and Thaler was the last experience I would have in
finance. I now wanted to focus more on machine learning and software and all
the good things that come with manipulating bits. I started working with
Virtualitics in the winter of my junior year (2017). They were building a
VR data visualization and analysis platform and I was helping them do QA
testing and build out distributed gridsearch. The work was fun, challenging,
and only made me more excited to get into software industry. That summer,
I went to work for Microsoft, also on a distributed machine learning platform.
It was my first time working for a big company, and I definitely liked the
perks of free drinks, corporate housing, a subsidized rental car. It was a
good summer, but I wasn't convinced that working for Microsoft, on that team,
was a particularly good fit. I interviewed with other teams but didn't land a
position anywhere else, so off to the interviewing tracks I went. You can
read my reflection about my final decision process for my current job
[here](../../04/27/how-i-chose-among-job-offers-fall-2018.html).

After a seriously long digression into way more details about my work
experience that you either wanted or needed to know, we are in senior year.
I decided, after all the hours I've spent on econometrics and options pricing
and macro and microeconomics, that I didn't
want to finish the last two classes I needed for the BEM major. So I dropped
it. My friends laughed at me. You may laugh at me. I had TWO classes left to
take: Intro to Finance and Venture Capital.

What can I say? The data changed enough that I had to acknowledge that I
didn't want to do
business / economics / management and no longer cared if it didn't appear on
my diploma. I agree with Andrew Yang that it's a shame that our current pool
of college graduates pretty much all go to finance, consulting, law, medicine,
grad school, tech. I think financiers are money grubbers who aren't really
changing the world. Real estate investors and Warren Buffett are useless
relative to people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Andy Grove and Ben
Horowitz, who actually put themselves on the line to build a better future.
Buffett and real estate investors literally do practically nothing but
sit there on their float or on their pieces of dirt and get richer. What
kind of role model is that for society? Do you want your kids to be inspired
by these people who can extract unlimited rent from the things they own but
do not have to operate or do you want them to be inspired by entrepreneurs,
our Presidents, our world leaders, the people who believe that they can build
progress? Jeez. I feel sad for my for people who choose to go into
finance or consulting. Their lives could be spent on more societally wholesome
issues, like fighting malaria or water treatment or blood transfusions or
poverty or XYZ addictions or depression or inequality or educating the next
generation etc. Instead, they
choose to burn themselves out in "pretty" career. It really is a
shame that we are so underpaying the people who are working on the hard
problems I listed above and that we also do not regard as successful those who
choose to leave society and pursue more human activities, like farming or
homesteading or
meditation or nirvana or just plain peace in a backcountry.

I've thought
about homesteading a lot. I've thought about going into the mountains and
subsisting off the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe.
I've thought about financial independence a lot.
I know work is necessary, but I know
[independence, freedom](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), is all we desire
and that we deserve to have it. Finance can give me independence, but I
don't think classroom finance is the kind of finance that leads to meaningful
outcomes. I want to learn finance from the real world, to pick up wisdom
from the rogue experts, from the people who see past the smoke
and mirrors that industry and "experts" and common sense knowledge
propagators who are incentivized in all the wrong ways put up. My real
education has only just begun. Follow my readings and learnings on Twitter
or on this blog or just plain email me. I want to meet new people and hope
that we can be engaging for each other.
