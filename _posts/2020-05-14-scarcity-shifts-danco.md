Read the original series [here](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/paradigm-shift-machine-part-1-technology-increases-access-to-what-is-scarce-1ed5cbc82537).

In this series, Alex overlays paradigms shifts with the Gartner hype curve. In
the beginning of the curve, people find a new scarce resource to capture and
make money off of by being a friction point in the chain from good to
consumer. At some point, technology radically reduces the friction and
radically increases the consumers' access to the good, spurring a bull run
of value + easy access. Now the old scarce resource is no longer scarce and
people start to see that companies can't actually make money off of
providing easy access, causing a crash as expectations recalibrate.
Eventually, people identify the new scarce resource and build profitable
companies around the new point of friction.

Alex gives a couple of simple examples regarding media and retail to
warm you up to the framework. Power in media used to be predicated on
control of either the content or distribution hierarchy. Once the Internet
slashed marginal distribution and content production costs to zero, new
scarce resources emerged around discoverability and attention. Netflix,
Google, FB, Youtube, and Buzzfeed have all learned to capitalize on those
two metrics. You can decreasing marginal returns, especially since Netflix
is concered about [competing with sleep and Fortnite](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-fortnite-competition-q4-earnings-2019-1). Retail used to be about shelf placement and brand
name. Then the Internet shook everything upside down and Amazon and Dollar
Shave Club and Warby Parker emerged to capitalize on the new scarce
resource of customer loyalty. You can also consider customer loyalty an
attention and discoverability problem. Of all the brands on the market, why
would I choose or even know about you, Pikachu?

The next set of examples is around social media. Facebook gave us a
megaphone but also demanded that we have one voice. It asked for careful
curation of our Internet lives, lest the wrong drunken photos or posts about
our nonstandard political leanings fall into the hands of people with power
over our futures. Now the scarce resource was range of personal
expressibility. Snapchat got all the headlines for its ephemeral messages
and for loosening the chains around our twitchy thumbs. Now we could post
whatever we want, knowing that any embarrassing content would disappear
when we wanted it to and that it would only be sent to those we wanted it
to be sent to. Alex compares Snapchat to the intensenly private, peer to
peer phone and Facebook to the public phonebook. Snapchat also has figured
out how to harness the power of the camera and its ability to spontaneously
capture what we can't put into words. But even Snapchat hasn't really
captured and monetized what people want, which Alex claims is the "Here and
Now" model employed by Twitch. The battle's not over yet, so keep your ears
perked for what happens next.

The next category is one Uber has captured. The scarce resource is people with
cars. Once smartphones and good maps came online, companies would leverage
people with cars to do more than than deliver themselves point to point: they
could be used to deliver other people, food, packages, etc. That's all fine and
dandy, but we all know Uber wasn't exactly profitable. Lyft also wasn't doing
much better in making money. That is, until Uber figured how to gouge people's
pockets (ahem, make money) with surge pricing. Uber hooked people onto the idea
of ordering a ride through their phone with low prices. Uber hooked drivers onto
the platform by offering income guarantees (provided you work like a slave and
give at least 75 rides during the hours of X and Y). For riders, not that
they've given up their cars for an app on their phones, they will take an Uber
even if the surge pricing causes them to bleed 5x the regular fare through their
noses (or Uber figures out your [regular route and charges you more for
it](https://therideshareguy.com/uber-is-ripping-off-frequent-riders-and-heres-how-to-avoid-it/).
For drivers, now that youv'e given up on holding another job, you've surrendered
your freedom to protest Uber taking bigger and bigger cuts out of that
guaranteed $1500 weekly income.

But driverless cars! What do driverless cars change? No more humans and their
pesky physical needs or operating errors. Effectively, greater productivity
per car. Greater productivity per car combined with lesser need to make cars
actually appealing to humans but appealing to fleet operators means that the
market may get flooded with cheap autonomous pieces of metal on wheels from
about every manufacturer out there. I made a jump there with fleet operators,
but it's hard to imagine people running fleets of one (like the Tesla model)
once the industry's matured. The industry may mature into the airline industry
or Uber may wise up and take a horizontally scaled approach to controlling
access to the fleet.

The final, and most mind blowing example Alex walks through is with the
evolution of energy. We first transformed energy by discovering electricity and
figuring out how to make it travel long distances and then how to store it.
We then took another step by providing everyone who wants to be connected access
to a highly reliable battery: the grid. The operational costs of this battery
account for 40 - 50% of our electricity bill. The grid gives us access when want
it and where we want it, at the expense of choice of how we get it. Now, the
choice hierarchy is expanding to include solar, primarily, but also wind and
water. Smart devices also help us control our energy consumption so we can
consume at the best times of day (cheapest, cleanest). The problem with
expanding the choice hierarchy is that it isn't financially viable without
also expanding the when and where of the battery options. This where electric
vehicles and improved personal energy storage comes into play. Of course,
without real choice in where energy for those vehicles or storage devices comes
from, there's no real economic incentives to keep plowing forward. So, the when
and where of energy and choice of energy source must evolve together. What
the final evolution will look like will probably be a distributed energy network
of large centralized players still feeding into the grid but also fringe
producers like your neighbor's PowerWall coming online to shed excess energy.
The new scarce resource of the commodity market is trust to engage with other
people in the market. And the opportunity for a player like Tesla to make
money is to control the infrastructure of the market (battery architecture,
software to facilitate the connections in the network, the energy generation /
collection mechanism).
