* [Art of Paragliding](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Paragliding-Dennis-Pagen/dp/0936310146)
  * Essential handbook for beginning and novice pilots.
* [Speed to Fly for Max Glide](https://flybubble.com/blog/speed-to-fly-basics)
  * Mostly useful if you're into XC or just like thinking about the technical
  challenges of flying a paraglider.
  * Main points:
    * Headwind, speed up.
    * Tailwind, trim or slower.
    * Sink, speed up.
    * Lift, slow down.
    * Sink + headwind, speed up sooner (it's easy to hit thresholds for improved glide in these conditions).
  * The author goes into more detail about the threshold at which speed bar
  achieves an equivalent glide path to trim. If this matters to you, you should
  do your own calculations to determine your personal thresholds for when you
  speed up based on your ability to control the glider and flying objectives.
* [Replacement Lines](http://www.adventuretoystore.com/ozone-replacement-line/)
  * In case something tears. Should be easy to replace yourself.
* [Untangle Your Lines At the Speed of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuLwObPKZYE)
  * Major point: start by tracing the inner A riser from the glider to your
  risers and getting all the other lines under that A. Then proceed with the
  other lines in order from top to bottom, from glider to riser.
