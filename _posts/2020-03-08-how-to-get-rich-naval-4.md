Listen to or read the podcast [here](https://nav.al/rich).

All my previous notes on this massive podcast conglomeration:
*  [Part 1 (1st Hour)](../../02/27/how-to-get-rich-naval.html)
*  [Part 2 (approx 2nd Hour)](../02/how-to-get-rich-naval-2.html)
*  [Part 3 (Rest of the tweet storm topics)](../05/how-to-get-rich-naval-3.html)

Now that Naval and Nivi have finished discussing the tweetstorm, the conversation is going to go more ad hoc. Basically,
the questions will be driven by whatever Nivi wants to talk about. Here we go. Some topics may feel repeated from previous
posts.

__Don't Take This Wrong Way__:<br>
I'd say the key takeaway from this podcast is to change your mindset around making money, getting rich, and overall attaining
your objectives in life. Another great resource for changing your mind around entrepreneurship and money is the
[My First
Million](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/digital-tithing-influencer-based-cloud-kitchens-uber/id1469759170?i=1000466926795)
podcast. [Shaan's episode with Moiz
Ali](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/using-%241k-to-build-%24100m-deodorant-business/id1469759170?i=1000447978165) of
[Native deodorant](https://www.nativecos.com) is the first episode I listened to.

If you *want* to pursue wealth creation in the way that Naval has suggested, you should resolving any mental blockers you have to
just getting started. You have to play the hand you've been dealt; podcasts like this merely try to help you play it a bit better.

Software has a heavy emphasis in this podcast because it's what made Naval who he is today, what's eating the world, and what has
the most leverage. Real estate is the other big category of leverage, mostly because property rights are powerful construct.

As with everything you read (on or off the Internet), *you* are in control of whether you accept or reject the information. This
podcast is not a direct line from Naval's or Nivi's mouth to your brain's central database. You should grapple with every
concept, every principle that was thrown out in these past couple of hours and decide whether it will make you a better person or
it is drivel.

__Kissing Up...Sorry, Levering Up__:<br>
One way to apply the advice in this podcast value chain at whatever company they're at and understand how the people above
you are leveraging larger quantities of capital, products, media, and community. Taking advantage of these learnings may require
moving to another org or starting your own company. But learning from an existing template will give you a head start in building
the next great org. Combine this strategy with the understanding that you'll get more visibility and accountability and innovation at
a smaller company and it might become obvious that you should structure your career in an inverted pyramid of company size.

Look at the people around you. If there is someone above you that you are not learning from, they shouldn't be above you. If there is
someone below you that you aren't mentoring or coaching or teaching, find a robot to replace them. You should maximize the value of your
interactions by only keeping the necessary people around.

__Ethics is Something You Do__:<br>
Taleb prefers inverting the Golden Rule into the much more powerful Silver Rule: “Don’t do unto others what you don’t want them doing unto you.”

Remember that most good, big things in the world come through compound interest. Remember also that most good big things come about through a
meeting of minds. Remember also that the brilliant minds in the world are likely highly connected and are a relatively small graph. What I"m
trying to say is that as you build a reputation for building awesome things and have smart business skills, you'll probably find yourself
interacting with the same set of people over and over and over again. It thus pays to establish a reputation for being ethical, for having
integrity. Not only will this reputation precede you and help you secure deals and establish inbound deal flow, it will make all your transactions
that much easier because you can focus on getting the job done with your partners. You don't have to play the scheming Machiavellian game and try
to outsmart the others in your dishonest cohort. It pays to be honest, and people know if you're honest and ethical by watching what you do. Own
up to your mistakes and leave a group if the circumstances become antithetical to your values.

Perhaps a cleaner way to state the above paragraph was to just ask you to think about the long-term consequences.

Note: Envy can be a powerful motivator. As can boredom.

__Incentives are Everything: Principal Agent Problem__:<br>
Famous quote from Napoleon or Julius Caesar: “If you want it done, Go. If not, Send.”
Basically, you have to do it yourself to get it done right.

Incentive design is perhaps the most important thing an agent can spend his time on. It informs all the other expected behavior from agents under him and
even agents partnering with him. It's probably impossible to ever get full alignment, but it's nevertheless important to give generous to event incentives
to your top agents and partners because people will figure out the unevenness in incentives and stop being aligned with you. People aren't stupid.

If you're currently an agent, you want to force yourself to think long-term (think about compounding) by thinking like a principal, or like an owner. If
you can align yourself with a principal, you will get catapulted through the org because they realize how powerful your thinking is. The principal
agent problem is perhaps the single biggest problem in management, so if you can completely avoid it by only working in small teams of people that were
meticulously selected for their character and are all economically aligned, you've saved yourself a world of additional effort.

One easy way to avoid the principal agent problem is to only deal with principals. This gets easier the smaller the team because there are fewer layers of
bureaucracy and specialization in between the person working your case and the person who actually cares about the performance line of the business.

__Minimize Downside Risk__:<br>
Taleb beat everyone to this topic with [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680) in 2012. You want to avoid
taking bets on things that could totally wipe you out. Gamblers have been managing this risk for years, often using something called the [Kelly
criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) to determine bet size. The Kelly criterion maximizes the geometric growth rate and almost surely
leads to a higher expected value of wealth than any other strategy in the long run. Read abut it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion).

The other idea in this realm is perhaps the hottest topic of the last year, maybe two years: Ergodicity.
Taleb of course has a hot take on the [concept](https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3). Taylor Pearson also has a piece about
[it](https://taylorpearson.me/antifragile-investing/). The key point with ergodicity is that ensemble averages aren't always the same as the individual
time series average. Take Russian Roulette. With 5 of 6 chambers empty, 83 of 100 prisoners in the lineup will survive. With 5 of 6 chambers empty, the
person who faces the gun 100 times in a row surely dies. I'm not sure exactly what you can do about things being non-ergodic, but at least you can
start to identify when the unique individual experience over time is different and thus when it makes sense to differ from "common wisdom".

__Schelling Points__:<br>
This is a fun topic. I think the first article I read about this was David Friedman's hot take on [Property
Rights](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Property/Property.html). David's article is excellent so I highly recommend you take the time to absorb
and ponder his argument and the beauty of the universe that emerges from it.

Anyway, Schelling Points are basically focal points (e.g. social norms). In game theory, they are solutions that people tend to choose in absence of
communication. Take a look at [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1226382240956866560) to understand a practical use. Or consider
where you would wait for a friend if you're both lost in a city without communication. Maybe McDonald's on a busy street? Or Starbucks? At the main
train station? Basically, you both share common knowledge. The Schelling point puts that common knowledge to the test and asks for a solution based
on social salience.

Not sure why Nivi wanted to talk about this...Perhaps because it's just an interesting concept that will probably come up in your highly intellectual
Twitter journeys.

__Our Friend Pareto__:<br>
[Pareto optimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) is when any other state is inferior in some way to the current state.
If you can move to another state that is preferred by all agents in the game, the current state is Pareto dominated by that preferred state. These
are fun and important game theory concepts to keep in mind during negotiations. You want to negotiate to the Pareto optimal contract.

One way to encourage Pareto optimal behavior from the other parties is to make the game repeated. The easiest way to bring in long-term thinking is to
bring in reputation. Use Yelp, Thumbtack, "I have another project I want to do but I will decide if I want you to work on it based on this project.", "I
have three friends who are also looking for contractors.", referrals. Negotiations are often won by the person who cares the least, or who has the lowest
opportunity cost, which is why bringing in reputation and upping the stakes can lead to more successful negotiation.

__Compounding Relationships Make the World Go Round__:<br>
We're back on trust, because trust makes everything just that much easier. Trust means you don't have to question whether the other person has your back or
whether they will agree on what to do if things turn sour or how to make the next major step in the enterprise. Friction between co-founders *has to be* a
major reason for startup failure. People fall apart or find out that their drives are misaligned or that they simply can't have a decent conversation about
serious company building decisions without devolving into impassioned arguing. Building that trust enables you to soar through difficult conversations, because
you know the other person has your back.

Understanding compounding means realizing that investing in one, long, uninterrupted stream of compounding will result in a bigger endgame than investing
in multiple, short-lived series of compoundings. It's better to have a few deep relationships, to be really good at a few things, than to be a social
butterfly with no real connections, a dilettante. Of course, embarking on a journey with the intention to reap long-term rewards requiring seeing that the
rewards won't come until the end. You'll have to stick it out through the thin, the hard, the sticky times because only when you emerge from the depths of
trouble will you be able to truly be [enlightened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaihōgyō). Oh, another point (one that you might find more palatable),
the restauranteur with 3 small scale Chinese restaurants works just as hard as Elon Musk; the Chinese restaurant guy will never make the money that Elon does.
Work smart and think big, because you're always going to have to work hard to get what you want.

__Pricing Theory__:<br>
I have a book called [Confessions of the Pricing Man](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Pricing-Man-Affects-Everything/dp/3319203991). I haven't read it yet,
so I can't tell you how much it actually helps in understanding pricing, but it's a resource you may want to look at.

Also take a look at this [25iq compilation](https://25iq.com/2012/12/06/charlie-munger-on-moats-first-of-the-four-essential-filters/) of Buffett and
Munger quotes on moats. There's a quote where Munger talks about the pricing power a brand like See's Candies has. Buffett has a quote later on in the
post about how some businesses could massively improve returns by increasing prices. Prices are important, and you can use them to your advantage to play
on people's desire for a better product (that doesn't actually cost you that much more). Do you think business class costs 3 - 10x as much as economy class
to the airline? Probably not, but by using some price discrimination to separate out people based on their capacity to pay, the
[airlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzB5xtGGsTc) can make a ton more money out of squeezing people into metal cans and chucking them into the air. Pay
attention to prices and try to find [smart ways to determine the supply-demand curve](https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/) for your products.

A related concept is the idea of consumer surplus. If your Starbucks coffee is worth $20 to you but you only pay $5 for it, you've just gained $15 in free surplus.
If you can determine that your buyers are getting a lot more value of your product than you are asking for, you are also facing a massive pricing opportunity.
Hopefully you have a business with enough of a moat to let you play with prices and witness some inelastic purchasing behavior. Munger has a nice quote about
businesses that simply can't capture any producer surplus and let everything run off into consumer surplus. Send it my way if you can find it and I'll insert it
into this post.

__Investing Concepts__:<br>
I just happened upon this series of posts today, but if you really want to get into the weeds of how to think about business the Buffett and Munger way,
I'd highly recommend the [25iq series on Munger's wisdom](https://25iq.com/2012/11/16/charlie-munger-on-mistakes/). I've done a lot of reading of Munger's
work, but it's nice to have it all compiled in one place with some small commentary.

__Externalities__:<br>
Here's the beautiful Wikipedia definition for a big bad term that people throw around with no serious intention of actually doing anything with:
An externality is a cost or benefit to a third party who has no control over how that cost or benefit was created. Externalities can be positive or
negative, but since people like focusing on the [bad things in the world](http://www.danielgilbert.com/LEVARI2018COMPLETE.pdf), externalities
these days are often brought up in conjunction with damage to the environment. One proposed solution to people damaging the environment is to
raise the cost of environment damaging actions like wasting water or polluting to the point where it's cheaper to do the environmentally friendly
thing. Of course, if raising prices on these things were so easy, we wouldn't still be here crying about how much water almonds and grapes drain
out of the dry, cracked, fire-roasted soil of California. As with most big societal blockers, [policy is more important than
technology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22422270) (and your smart\*\*\* comments about externalities).

__Investing in Yourself__:<br>
* Increase accountability
* Increase founder mentality
* Increase specific knowledge (getting to the point where you don't have a clear answer to "what do you do every day?")
  * Get an apprenticeship (chief of staff, driver for the Don)
* Pursue your interests as aggressively as you can
* Increase your grasp of technical fundamentals so you can leverage the specific knowledge built into the technical frontiers
* Engage in activities with increased leverage
  * Do things that move the bottom line
* Think long-term and try to bring compounding on your side

I hope you enjoyed this series (didn't find my commentary totally useless).
