Let's talk a bit about flight planning today. I just completed a training
trip with my instructor and two friends (see photo) out to Chino airport
today. This flight was originally meant for Tuesday, 1/22, but there were
still very strong winds from the windstorm on Monday (gusting 9 - 26kts), so
we postponed to today.

El Monte (KEMT), which is nicknamed Elmoo on TACs (terminal area charts), is
our home airport. Chino is about 21nm south east of El Monte.
To get to Chino, we will pass under Ontario's airspace. This means our
altitude will be limited to 2500'.

Notice there is another airport that is in between KEMT and KCNO: KPOC, or
Brackett. Their airspace extends down to the northern intersection of the
60 and 57 freeways. We will avoid them by aiming towards the southern
intersection of the 60 and 57 freeways. Be careful not to mistake the compass
rose for their airspace.

Approximate final trajectory:

Assuming runway 19 (preferred runway) is in use from KEMT, we'll ask for a
left crosswind, or southeast departure. It just happened that day that the
winds were favoring runway 1, so we asked for a right crosswind departure. We
made our right turn fairly early, at about 300ft AGL, or 500' MSL. We aimed
for the hotel on a hill, which is the blue region just north of the
Pomona Freeway flag on the TAC. From there, we aimed for the southern 60/57
intersection, then straight on towards Chino.

We talked with Chino tower about 10 miles out, or when we crossed the 57.
Winds were variable that day, so there was a bit of turbulence heading over
Puente Hills. Normally, runway 26 is favored at Chino, but that day, winds
were mostly favoring runway 8. We landed 8L, and got off at Kilo.

We did two touch and go's (if my memory is behaving properly) on 8L before we
asked for a runway change to RW 3. Again, winds were variable. There was a
helicopter practicing on the north east side of RW 3, so ATC took some time to
move him. We were almost on base when ATC asked us to delay and head further
south because a jet was coming in. We obeyed by climbing a bit to the south
then gently circling over the cow fields.

The pilot of this jet was really something. He initially said something to ATC
that was relevant for Ontario. ATC corrected him and then gave him
instructions on heading to Ontario. The pilot didn't repeat instructions back
correctly, so ATC continued to work with him on making sure he got the
frequencies right and was clear on his intentions. Once that was done, we got
cleared to approach RW 3...until that jet decided it was actually going to
land at Chino. So we proceeded to circle again. We watched the jet land,
then made our final touch and go on RW 3 before heading back to El Monte.

Here's a couple random notes regarding Chino airport. You can really smell
the cows. The airport is surrounded by a bunch of lush, green fields, some of
which have cows. Mind you, we're flying something like 1400 - 2200', and the
smell of manure is still hitting hard. There is also a temple just west of
Chino airport. I didn't get any photos, but it's really a sight from the air.
They have a big pink building with a gray star on top. There are also two
prisons near the airport. Those are certainly useable as markers for final
approach.

We executed left crosswind after takeoff from RW 3. We pretty much retraced
our path over Diamond Bar, then angling up to the 10, then following the
10 back for right traffic onto RW 1. We contacted KEMT about 10 nm out.
Overall, this was a pretty uneventful training trip. There was a bit of
turbulence, but nothing big enough to bother me or my passengers.

I brought two friends with me that day, so weight and balance calculations
were definitely a necessary procedure before the flight. Here's a picture of
the numbers I used:

We filled up pretty much to max gross, so 30 gals of fuel. 760's fuel
consumption is about 7.4gph, so at 42nm straight line round trip distance,
and 110kts cruising speed, we had plenty of margin for all the other things
we wanted to do that day.

Here's a free online service where you can track flights. The flight I just
described was from [1/24, 10:57am - 12:07pm](
