Note: This post is heavy on the complaining.

Update 08/22/2019: Did I mention that the house doesn't have air conditioning?
This past week has been absolute brutal. Temperatures have been over 90deg,
reaching probably over 100deg in this 50 year old (almost 60 yr old) house
with insulation so bad that it traps heat. It's practically inhumane to be
in this house in the summer.

Hello all, it's been a while since I last posted. For those who have the
luxury of idle time and pliable, trigger-ready thumbs and an internet
connection fast enough to browse the hottest social network, LinkedIn, you
may have noticed that I've added a new position for the month of July. I am
now the lead software engineer for a stealth fashion startup. That's been
keeping me reasonably busy, but so has iQiyi 2018 (愛奇藝) hit television show
<<延禧攻略>> and buying (way too much) stuff for the house I'm currently
renting in the permeated with Chinese money and yet completely lacking in
Asian stores and supremely overpriced and a prime example of suburban America
Palo Alto.

First, moving. Moving literally only makes sense by car. As much as I'd have
preferred to cut the travel time by half and fly from San Diego to San Jose
(SJC), my family "road tripped" up to the Bay Area. I put road trip in quotes
because I don't really consider a barely 8 hour drive, with ample stops in
the middle for bathroom / stretch breaks and gas, a road trip. A road trip
should involve multiple days of driving, like [Casey Neistat's road trip from
NY to LA](https://twitter.com/casey/status/1137739002805727232?lang=en).

Anyway, once you get past LA (where there is inevitably a slowdown on the 5
or 405), you hit Bakersfield and the land of central California, which is
basically just the land of cows and farmland and golden grass and
nothingness... Life is not that bleak there, but don't expect to see the glitz
and glam of LA or SD or the Bay, the three major metropolitan hub of
apparently the country's most desirable state to live in, California. Do note
that highway 152, which takes you from the I-5 to Gilroy, is a prime road
along which to stop at any of the roadside fruit stands and pick up some real
good prices for avocados (we were seeing 6 for $1...I've only seen corn at
those prices, at Sprouts) or peaches or cherries or strawberries or garlic
ice cream. Check in at another season for the local produce.

The road trip was otherwise uneventful. The minivan we rented was packed to
the limit, with every gadget and gizmo I still had some sentimental value for
packed into some corner or cranny of the spacious Grand Caravan. We arrived
in Fremont in the evening and ate an authentic Taiwanese dinner at
[渡小月](https://www.yelp.com/biz/du-xiao-yue-fremont-2), which is across the
freeway from the Tesla Supercharger Fremont Factory. (Tesla factory tours
are not bad, but I'm not sure if they still do them.)

The next day (8/2) was moving day 1. We met up with our realtor's assistant,
Nima, to go over the house. I can't say the house was a disaster, but it
certainly had (has) some problems that should have been fixed a while ago...
ahem. Major issue one: ants! Gah, ants are disgusting little creatures that
require serious extermination effort, like a Terminix service appointment,
to get rid of. Some of you are brave enough to just spray Raid and but bait
down, but putting bait down means you will have a whole stream of ants
swarming the bait pad and Raid has not seemed to be effective enough for us.
Issue number 2: Side and back doors were not functioning. We had to bother
the assistant to get a handyman to fix this for us. Issue number 3: Smoke
detectors were not properly installed, so a handyman had to fix that for us.
Issue number 4: furnace not functioning properly, so the handyman also
adjusted that for us. Issue number 5: shower produces black water when you
first turn it on. I assume it's an installation issue, but two days and it's
still regurgitating watery coal.

Luckily, the Xfinity cable guy, whom we paid $90 for, was efficient and
effective. Thanks to Xfinity for my <=150Mbps download speed internet @
~$60/month.

Note on utilities. Trash here, for a 96-gal trash bin (recycling and compost
are included, no matter the size), is $150 a month. It costs no more than
$100 a month for water AND trash, with 96-gals, even multiple gals, where my
parents live...jeez. Also...the house has been vacant for a few months?
Another issue: recycling cans were full, trash pickup is on Tuesday, and we
had about a million and a half cardboard boxes we needed to crush.

So after all the nonsense with the house was either fixed or put on the list
of things to fix for the assistant and realtor and owner, we started to
move in and assemble all the furniture and whatnot we ordered and brought up.

Note to self. I really really really hate assembling furniture and will never
agree to do another Ikea type DIY assemble your own furniture like a hillbilly
with too much time on his hands. I nearly lost my mind trying to put together
a chest of drawers from Wayfair. Was supposed to take 45 minutes for one
person...we took many hours and produced a few white hairs in the process. And
the instructions said *not* to use power tools?! We did get a
[beautiful adjustable height](https://www.costco.com/Tresanti-Adjustable-Height-Desk.product.100470111.html)
desk from Costco, though.

After day 1's move in was completed, we went to Tea Station in Newark for a
late dinner.

I am not going to deny that this piece is a complaining piece. What I will
say, though, is that I hope this record of my first real move-in (last move
in was to college, and that was insanely painless because housing there
actually takes care of most of these things) will be useful for future moves.

Note to self on rent. Rent is $6000 / month.

Day 2 of moving (8/3), back to the house to complain about some ants and
assemble more furniture and buy food. Oh, I almost forgot. I was supposed to
pick up my Tesla today (*shiny*). But...someone screwed up and our car was
sold to someone else on Day 1 of moving. Why did that happen? Well, Tesla
model 3's are popular...so the company only holds cars for 7 days. Fine, fine,
I understand. But no one told us the car was ready for delivery on Jul 26. We
thought it was ready for delivery on Jul 31. Jul 26 + 7 days = Aug 2, the day
our car got pawned off to some other eager customer. Jul 31 + 7 days = Aug 7,
plenty of time for us to get the car. So we go to the delivery center in
Fremont, practically get on our knees to beg some floor manager sales lady
for our car, escalate to some division sales manager, again practically beg
for our car, some kind of compensation for this injustice, a loaner(?) for a
few days, more supercharging miles(?), and they say they'll ask the factory
for a rush delivery for the next day (8/4). Say what you want, we didn't
know that our car was due to be booted on 8/2.

Day 3 of moving (8/4), go pick up my Tesla. Literally no one is at the
delivery center. We go over the necessary paperwork, do a walk through of the
car, go over some features with the delivery specialist, and then I drive
off to lunch with a Caltech classmate who is interning at Facebook. We eat at
[Ramen Nagi](https://ramennagiusa.com), a tonkotsu only place in Santa Clara
and Palo Alto that the Bay apparently thinks serves the best bowl of noodles
known to the world. We got to the Santa Clara mall around 2:15, and were
quickly led inside the small but noisy (they were blasting some Japanese pop
rock) dining area. The ramen is totally customizable and cost about $17
after adding an egg and tip. This ramen scares and disgusts me. The chasu
(you can swap for pork belly) comes out pink. I don't like the look of pink
pork. I don't know if I'm mentally convincing myself that the pork tastes
gamey but I almost threw up while eating one of the pieces of chashu. You
could taste the fat and I couldn't help but want to die because the pork
was pink. The soup was super super extra highly visibly oily. Tonkotsu broth
should be a beautifully creamy white mixture of fat and water. This was not
that. It was white broth with a layer of fat on top. Like you could run this
broth through a strainer and you could peel off that layer of fat bubbles.
The broth didn't taste bad, but the look of the fat also nearly made me want
to hurl and throw myself over the banister. The noodles were an ok texture.
Needless to say, I did not like Ramen Nagi and will happily go back to Pasadena
for Hiro Nori or Chibiscus Ramen.

After ramen, I drove back to Palo Alto to unload some foods and to get ready
to go out to eat again, this time at the renowned
[Madras Cafe](http://www.madrascafe.us) in Sunnyvale. Why is this place
renowned? You'll need to ask my Indian friends, but it apparently serves great
dosas and other South Indian foods. The mango lassi was good, but I really
don't understand how to eat dosas. Food is cheap though, lassi at $3.50(?) and
dosa at < $8. I ate with another friend from Caltech, who will be starting
work at eBay once her work authorization goes through. She was supposed to
start 8/5 but is now delayed until at least 8/19.

The most interesting part of our conversation was her statement about how she
doesn't think life in the suburbs is right for her. I was going to write
another post just about "why not to live in the suburbs", but I guess I can
save you the wait and spill the beans here:
* Car dependency

That's all you need to know about why the suburbs are bad for your health,
your social life, your mental resilience, your happiness, your everything. So
pack your bags and move to a real city, like Vancouver or Tokyo or Melbourne,
or anywhere else on [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_livable_cities).

Check back in another day for the rest of the reasons why I don't like the
suburbs. Tomorrow is my first day of work at
[Thoughtspot](https://www.thoughtspot.com). I will see you soon.
