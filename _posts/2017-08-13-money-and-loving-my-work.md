I am constantly struggling with the idea that money is not an end but a means to an end. I am so disappointed and frustrated and sick of being stuck in the quicksand of miserable work that I just want to escape and become financially independent. But, as Paul Graham says in his wonderful piece about doing what you love, finding your passion is not easy. And I’ve come to understand that anything worth getting in life is going to be hard. Anything worth living for or standing up for is going to be hard.

So I’m not going to give up. I’ll slave away at whatever miserable internship or job or class I have to to build up a skillset that will allow me to have my pick among work I think will be enjoyable. I’ll keep producing results. The only way I can find what I like to is to just keep trying everything. Success is never wrought in one day, and my success in finding some work that makes me really enjoy life and makes me crave to wake up each morning to get back to my desk will not be wrought in one day. It certainly hasn’t been wrought over the years I’ve lived so far.

One day, I hope to come back to my writing desk and say that I have found my passion. I want to come back here, overflowing with passion, and say that I have found my purpose in life. We were all brought into this life to fulfill a purpose to society. We are all rewarded based on our contributions to society. I hope I will be able to discover my purpose to society so that I create a world where my vision and my passion can be played out for the benefit of mankind.
