title: Reading of Quote from Victor Frankl
---

<section class="content">

<p>This is my first try at recording myself reading content for the public.
I have a great appreciation for Victor Frankl and his work 
<u>Man's Search for Meaning in Life</u>. His work was the first I 
turned to when I began experiencing spritual existential anxiety. I hope 
you enjoy this piece.</p>
