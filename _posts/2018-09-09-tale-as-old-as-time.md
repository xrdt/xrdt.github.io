Here's a rather easy and classic song for everybody: Tale as Old as Time, from
Disney's "Beauty and the Beast".

*Tale as Old As Time*
2 3 3’ 4 F
Tale as old as time
2 3 3’ 4 4’
True as it can be
4 4’ 5 5’ 6
Barely even friends
6 5’ 5 4’ 4
Then somebody bends,
5’ 5 4’ 4 3
Unexpectedly

2 3 3’ 4 F
Just a little change
2 3 3’ 4 4’
Small to say the least
5 4’ 5 6 4
Both a little scared
4 3’ 4 5 A
Neither one prepared
5 5’ 4’ 5 4
Beauty and the Beast

4 4’ 5 5’ 6
Ever just the same
4 4’ 5 6’ 6
Ever a surprise
4 4’ 5 5’ 6
Ever as before
6 5’ 5 4’ 4
Ever just as sure
4 4’ 5 4 4’
As the sun will rise

2 3 3’ 4 F
Tale as old as time
2 3 3’ 4 4’
Tune as old as song
4 4’ 5 5’ 6
Bittersweet and strange
6 5’ 5 4’ 4
Finding you can change
5’ 5 4’ 4 3
Learning you were wrong

2 3 3’ 4 F
Certain as the sun
2 3 3’ 4 4’
Rising in the east
5 4’ 5 6 4
Tale as old as time
4 3’ 4 5 A
Song as old as rhyme
5 5’ 4’ 5 4
Beauty and the beast

5 4’ 5 6 4
Tale as old as time
4 3’ 4 5 A
Song as old as rhyme
5 5’ 4’ 5 4
Beauty and beast
