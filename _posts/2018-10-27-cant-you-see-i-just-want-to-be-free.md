Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Let everything go, so I can be me<br>
Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Break the chains around my mind, I'm soaring, one two three<br>

They been in school from 8am until 2<br>
2 in the afternoon, all the kids heading back from school<br>
Everyday the shackles on their minds grow thicker<br>
Until they so burdened they think just like their middle-aged teachers<br>
They been taught that society is their God<br>
That having a car, living in 'burbs, planning for retirement is their lot<br>
But their hearts, oh their hearts are rebellious<br>
Saying this is a lie, this isn't life, this will turn them into rye<br>
But they been taught the tenets of rationality<br>
That science and its methods are the peak deductions of human society<br>
That emotions make people weak, especially men, because they gotta stand up
and fight for their families<br>
So the heart is repressed, in favor of mathematics, computation, and a bit of
cynical reality<br>
And what we end up with is a bunch of existentially stressed teenagers,
wouldn't you call that anxiety<br>

Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Let everything go, so I can be me<br>
Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Follow the truth, for all eternity<br>

Why have we been taught to give up our hearts?<br>
To fit into societal molds and force a smile so we can be who we're not<br>
and do what we're not meant to do<br>
Why have we corrupted the meaning of work?<br>
Turned it into something that we do just to get by<br>
Forgetting that without it, we'd die<br>
Stability, benefits, salary, don't by shy<br>
You don't need to lie, I know you want to be high<br>
up the pay scale, you aiming to move beyond the retail<br>
But focus! Don't get distracted by all that hocus<br>
pocus. They tryin' to trap you with high income, expenses<br>
So that you can't escape, you'd feel burdened and defenseless<br>

Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Let everything go, so I can be me<br>
Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Away from society, floating in the breeze<br>

So you take a vacation out to Hawaii<br>
Thinking sitting on the beach will clear you mind, wowee<br>
Book a cabana on Maui, don't mistake it for Malawi<br>
Lay down on the sand, book in hand, get a tan on my body<br>
You start getting bored, antsy, wanting to do something with your hands<br>
You're so jacked into the digital world that nature has lost its command<br>
You try meditating but you'd rather fall asleep in the sand<br>
You try reading but your phone's in reach, you can't stop your hand<br>
You try hiking but you're out of shape, heart rate rising faster than the
land<br>
You start feeling depressed, wanting to go home<br>
You feel there's a hole in your heart bigger than the one in the ozone<br>
Welcome to the withdrawal period<br>
You gotta recalibrate, reacclimate, regenerate<br>
Rediscover your true self<br>

Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Let everything go, so I can be me<br>
Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Keep pushing harder, until I'm stronger than entropy<br>

You go back to work, try to act refreshed<br>
But your heart ain't in it, you've seen the repressed<br>
So you sell your possessions and move away, trying not to regress<br>
You land in a rural town, stranger to all the frowns<br>
From all the people who've settled down<br>
And you spend the night in a nightgown<br>
Laying on a pile of down, thanking the kind brown<br>
Farmer who showed you the small town<br>
Hospitality and gave you the strength and vitality<br>
To continue this rightfully liberating spiritual journey<br>
So today, today is the day I open the cage holding my heart<br>
Turns out I had the keys all along, I just needed to do my part<br>
Stop going to the minimart and drowning my sorrows in ciroc<br>
Stop ignoring my art and denying the higher values<br>
It's time to follow my north star, let the truth carry me through<br>

Can't you see I just want to be free<br>
Let everything go, so I can be me<br>
Can't you see that I'm finally free<br>
Finally, I've completed this journey<br>
