Dead simple explanations of how your body [oxidizes (turns into
energy)](https://fireinabottle.net/category/obesity/) food and why modern
American diets are correlated with
[obesity](https://fireinabottle.net/category/obesity/). PUFAs (polyunsaturated
fats, which are found in high quantities in seed and vegetable oils) suck
because they disrupt our reactive oxygen species driven satiety and fat burning
mechanisms (you do want to burn fat, right?). Nothing new here, if you've been
following along with what my nutritional and [optimal health rogue
experts](../../../books_readings.html#rogue_experts) have been saying.

[This is exactly the kind of thing Ben Thompson was talking about when he said
he was bullish on local journalism](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1300823531912007681)

[Designing a secure JS-based plugin environment for
Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/)
  * Nice little technical dive into what it takes to create secure, environment
  for devs to program in that can still interact with the global Figma canvas.

[For those who want to revisit their assumptions about the inevitabilities of
economies of scale and laugh at the inefficiencies of big state governments](https://twitter.com/wrathofgnon/status/1235770601316519938)
  * Optimal scale appears to be pretty human scaled; that is, max 50 people
  teams.

[Stratechery on US Leverage Against China in Tech
"Cold War" (2019)](https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/)
  * China started the war *way* long ago. It banned US information brokers,
  like Google and FB and IG and YouTube years ago. The US is merely flexing a
  little with the ZTE ban and now Huawei.
  * China holds the upper hand in scale and rare earths and cheap labor.
  * US holds the upper hand in advanced technologies, especially if it can get
  other advanced technology manufacturers like Korea, Japan, and Taiwan on its
  side.
  * Silicon Valley and tech centers in the US and consumers fat on Apple
  products aren't happy with the idea of tariffs and limitations on the trade
  that gets them their supply. But what's at stake here is more than profits.
  It's an ideological war about "censorship versus openness, control versus
  creativity, and centralization versus competition."

[Alan Kay on how to Make the Computer Revolution Happen](https://mprove.de/visionreality/media/kay-CRA2002.pdf)
  * Connect the internet, personal computing (real persons doing computing), and
  computer literacy for all. Computer literacy = teaching people to shape and
  understand computer stuff. People need to be able to learn over the internet,
  on their personal computers that can "furnish its needed part of the
  simulation, rendering, replication, fault tolerant, and resynchronization
  processes which could do their job with DSL rates and above." We should build
  a "flexibly competent computer tutor for subject matter that is best taught by
  helping the learner construct their own knowledge." Flexible also means
  adaptive user interface. Each person should see the best user interface for
  their learning needs.
  * He also mentions Dynamic Math in the context of
  [Squeak](https://squeak.org). This is some kind of programming abstraction
  that has allowed the Squeak code to be extremely compact. I don't really
  understand this part, since I've yet to work with Squeak.

My understanding of Thiel is super surface level. I'd read Zero to One. I'd
watched a couple of interviews with him. I'd read some of his essays. But I
don't know the man in any deep way, least of all in an intellectually deep way.
I haven't gone through and
[fact-checked](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/) [Perell's article on
Thiel](https://www.perell.com/blog/peter-thiel), but I think Perell did a
reasonable job summarizing and thickening the soup of mimetic theory and
Millenialist Christianity and Accelerationism that Thiel has been publicly
cooking.

[Li Lu's Treatise on Modernization](https://web.archive.org/web/20180826152436/https://www.himalayacapital.com/index_files/Li%20Lu%20on%20Discussion%20of%20Modernization%202016%20Final.pdf)
  * I caught on to Li Lu many years ago because of Munger's great praise for his i
  investing capability. I haven't paid much attention to him recently, but I
  hold enough superficial respect for his name that my ears perked up when I
  found this treatise of his in an email newsletter.
  * History is created “by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier,
  more profitable, and safer ways to do things.” -- Ian Morris.
  * Ian Morris quantitatively measures the progress of a society (Societal
  Development Index) by understanding that society's ability to capture and use
  energy:
    * energy capture / person
    * social organization (pop of largest permanent dwelling unit)
    * Information Technology
    * War-making capacity
  * From 14,000 BCE, the West had been ahead of the east. From 500 - 1770 CE,
  the East was ahead of the West. Now, it looks like the east might again catch
  up and exceed the West.
  * Civilization has gone through three stages. Hunter-gatherer was 1.0.
  Agriculture was 2.0. Industrialization is 3.0.
  * Civilization 2.0 emerged in the Fertile Crescent and in Asia. These agrarian
  were subject to five disasters and the constant heckling of the nomads
  (Mongolians for a lot post CE time).
    * Famine
    * War from population movement
    * Epidemic
    * Climate change
    * Failure of government
  * Human thinking hit a new peak during the agrarian age between 800 - 300BC.
  This is known as the Axial Age. Think Confucius, Old Testament writers,
  Siddhartha Gautama, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle as wave 1. They were concerned
  with the pain of the common man, esp. after the destruction of civilization.
  They were preoccupied with the groans of the underclass, the struggles of
  those on the periphery. They pondered the meaning of life; the structure of
  good government; the signs of a good society. They advocated compassion for
  their fellow man and the establishment of people first states. The Golden and
  Silver Rules were governing principles for individual interactions.
    * The second wave of the Axial Age came after civilization collapsed. It was
    focused on comforting the soul. Religions like Buddhism, Christianity,
    Islam, Judaism, took center stage and promised their followers liberation
    through the afterlife.
    * The most important developments of the Axial Age were the establishment
    of complex government systems. In China, the Keju imperial examination
    system gave everybody across the country an equal and fair opportunity to
    advance themselves. All societies recognized the advantages of free trade
    and created governments that supported free trade.
  * Why did China fall behind the West and not become the seat of modernity?
  It was still under the limiting spell of neither having a free market nor
  modern science and technology (Qianlong refused modern trinkets in 1793).
  It was still under attack by nomadic peoples, so it was too busy leveraging
  the business class its ATM to ensure internal stability to be concerned with
  modernization and exploring new continents. Besides, the Pacific is a
  more treacherous and larger body of water than the Atlantic to traverse.
  * Civilization 3.0 emerges when a society combined constantly advancing
  science and technology and a free market economy to produce sustainable (here
  I have a bit of concern because it's not clear that humans can, despite their
  ingenuity, continually produce sufficient efficiency gains to beat natural
  resource exhaustion) compound growth. This is a time defined by creative
  destruction.
    * Governments do not excel at creative destruction. They excel in tasks that
    require planning budgeting, like building long term infrastructure or
    accelerating advances in traditional industries like coal, oil, chemical
    products. Government intervention is a godsend when it comes to helping a
    society catch up, which is why Chinese government intervention has performed
    remarkably well from 1970 - 1910s.
    * Once the society has caught up to the standard of other modern developed
    societies, it is best for the government to back off and protect and support
    the free market mechanisms that allow innovation in science and technology
    to flourish.
    * The Iron Law of Civilization 3.0 is that there will only be one freely
    competitive market. Societies which refuse to participate will fall behind
    and eventually get sucked up into the market. Thus, it is best for each
    society to break down any barriers to participation in this market.
  * How will the future of China look once it's done catching up and needs to
  transform its government? It cannot abandon its culture. It would be wise for
  China to return to its Confucian roots and add a sixth bond to the [five
  Confucian bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism#Relationships):
  honesty for strangers.
    * LiLu thinks the ultimate Chinese government structure will be one that
    combines the merits of the Keju examination system with those of a
    constitutional democracy. Keju solved the problem of how to find those with
    qualifications to lead. Constitutional democracies protect individual
    freedoms and promote free markets.
  * The defining characteristics of a good Civilization 3.0 government:
    * Protect private property
    * Provide free space for science and technology innovation
    * Minimize direct economic intervention
    * Independent judiciary and strict, objective enforcement of the law
    * Government instruments, like the military must be subject to
    constitutional limits
    * Leaders are qualified through examinations. Elites should rule the country.
    These examinations increase in difficulty as one moves up the hierarchy.
    These leaders must be subject to strict scrutiny and correspondingly strict
    punishments for misbehavior.
    * In order to prevent financial corruption and incentivize everyone with
    aptitude and interest to participate in government, pay for top government
    officials should be indexed against top pay for similar positions in the
    private sector.
  * Humans desire equality of outcome (I'm not sure that's true, but maybe I've
  been tainted by the constant encouragement to be ambitious and constant public
  lauding of those who have achieved outsized success.) but settle for equality
  of opportunity.
  * East and West are still highly suspicious of each other. The East was
  subjugated by the West for a long time. The West doesn't want to see its rank
  drop. But these fears must be overcome so that future relations are based on
  rational honesty and eventually trust and cooperation. Unity of the human race
  may become a reality.

[Animal Fat and Protein Intake Negatively Correlated with Cardiovascular Disease
Mortality](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/food-consumption-and-the-actual-statistics-of-cardiovascular-diseases)
  * Cholesterol increases on a higher animal foods diet. Cholesterol has no
  relation to cardiovascular disease risk.
  * Higher animal foods intake correlates with reduced blood pressure and
  reduced fasting blood glucose.

[Metabolic Winter and Food Triangle](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/met.2014.0027)
  >  In our practice of eating, we are apt to be influenced too much by taste
  [and] the dictates of the palate; we are prone to let natural instinct be
  overruled by acquired appetite. We need to observe our diet and regulate
  appetite by reason. In doing this we may be greatly aided by the knowledge of
  what our food contains and how it serves its purpose in nutrition.
  -- Wilbur Atwater, 19th century nutritionist.
  * Hat tip to nutrition twitter for pointing out this fascinating review.
  * Rather than relying on natural instinct when choosing what foods to eat and
  when to eat, many of us have allowed acquired appetite to dominate regulation
  of our dietary intake.
  * Concepts like calories and protein, fat, carbs, emerged in the 1800s, when
  people frequently could not get sufficient calories. Foods were viewed as
  carriers of protein + energy. Protein deficiency caused initial food marketing
  to be focused on the relative economics of wheat vs meat, for example, for
  meeting daily protein needs. The discovery of vitamins in the 1920s added
  another weapon to the food marketers' arsenals.
  * To accommodate the modern lack of protein and calorie deficiency, the
  authors designed a food triangle with foods of low energy density, like leafy
  greens, at the apex, and foods with higher energy density, like meats and
  dairy, and fruits and cereals and starches, as the base vertices. The use of
  the triangle is not explained in this article but in a follow up that I review
  below.
  * Calorie restriction triggers a network of longevity genes. Excessive intake
  of macronutrients, for example methionine, is negatively correlated with
  longevity. Longevity genes:
    * IGF-1
    * mTOR
    * AMPK
    * SIRT1 - 7
      * SIRT1 is a key regulator of energy homeostatis and metabolism through
      PGC-1\alpha and HIF-1\alpha. PGC-1\alpha is involved in non shivering
      thermogenesis.
  * Adults are very capable of maintaining and building stores of BAT. This
  suggests that we are evolutionarily designed to go through periodic cold
  stress. Combined with the previous bullet, we seem to even be designed to go
  through periods of caloric restriction.
  * Modern people are chronically sleep deprived (so much uncertainty about what
  the heck sleep is and how much we need...). Too little sleep is associated with
  obesity and cardiometabolic diseases (nasty stuff, really).
    * Reduced sleep leads to " impaired glucose tolerance and insulin
    resistance, increased appetite through changes in leptin and ghrelin levels,
    and reduced energy expenditure."
    * Melatonin lowers core body temperature.
  * Average daily energy expenditure has not changed since hunter gatherer
  times, so exercise is really not the major bottleneck in you achieving your
  body composition and metabolic goals. This isn't to say that exercise is
  meaningless (Katy Bowman and Pete Egoscue and nearly everybody else in this
  fitness / nutrition world can attest to that), but that the majority of your
  gains will be in the kitchen or at the dining table. In contrast to the
  previous challenges of calorie scarcity, we are now faced with the issue of
  how to allow reason to guide us through this world of constant food excesses.

[Oxidative Priority Etc Review Article](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/met.2016.0108)
  * Same authors as the previous article.
  * Fuel partitioning matters a lot more than a pure calories in calories out
  model would have you think. That's why many nutrition Twitter people say "eat
  as much protein as you want".
  * Respiratory quotient (RQ) is a huge tool in helping to understand which fuel
  sources (fat protein carb) are being oxidized.
    * Average fat (lipid) RQ ~ 0.7.
    * Average CHO RQ ~ 1.0.
    * Average Amino acid ~ 0.87 (ranges from 0.6 - 1.17).
    * Average alcohol ~ 0.67.
  * Fasted RQ ~ 0.85, which means half CHO half fat oxidation. This is when
  glycogen stores are still intact.
    * Vigorous activity (ahem exercise) increases RQ, which really means
    increased carb oxidation. You ain't burning fat when you run for an hour.
    If you're looking to reduce body fat percentage, the gains in energy
    expenditure from exercise are easily negated by subsequent increases in
    feeding because you didn't significantly improve fat oxidation.
  * Alcohol > Protein > Carb > Lipid. This is the golden chain of oxidative
  priority. It also represents the relative ease of storage of each type of
  nutrient.
    * If you eat pure ethanol, fat oxidation will be reduced by 87%.
    * If you eat ethanol then glucose, CHO oxidation increases 249% and fat
    oxidation goes to 0 for 90 min. The 4 hour post ethanol + glucose fat
    oxidation is reduced 79%. Watch those wine + cheese + crackers hors
    d'oeuvre.
  * People these days tend to eat very frequently. This disrupts fasted fat
  oxidation because the body has to figure out how to deal with what you just
  shoved it so it can prevent excess levels of postprandial nutrients in the
  blood.
  * You can use the food triangle to understand how your diet will affect your
  body composition. Eating too many foods at the bottom of the triangle (fat
  and CHO heavy foods) will result in weight gain. It is better to go paleo
  or vegan (choose either side of the triangle + the apex) for health.
  * Fascinating how the metabolism preference of protein fat and CHO in the body
  is totally the opposite of the ease of combustibility outside.
