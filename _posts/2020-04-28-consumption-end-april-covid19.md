Another month of COVID-19 induced shelter at home (don't worry, I have another
month to look forward to) and another month of Netflix
and way too much Internet nonsense and Twitter and generally not reading
enough books...oh, and missing office lunch with my coworkers.

This list is for sure not comprehensive, but well, it does an acceptable enough
job of keeping track of the big things that flew into my brain this month.

Let's begin with TV:
* FMA
  * I, like many others, really enjoyed the FMA manga. I was hoping the anime
    would be similarly delightful, but I found it moved way too slowly for my
    taste. They also introduced a bunch of random characters, none of which I
    thought actually added anything to the plot. By the time I got to the 4th
    or 5th episode, I couldn't handle the anime any more and decided like I'd
    rather go back and enjoy the manga.
* Person of Interest
  * I got introduced to this show one slow evening senior year. I'm still on the
    first season, but I don't have a strong reason to stop yet. Sure, I felt at
    some points that every episode basically was the same thing and that it
    wasn't as highbrow of television as the Wire, but things are really starting
    to heat up with the underground syndicates and corrupt operations. I can't
    wait to see how everything links together.
* Somebody Please Feed Phil
  * I watched the NY episode and the Israel episode just because I wanted to see
  what good food looked like again. I'm honestly surprised to see how genuinely
  genial a guy Phil is. I haven't seen "Everybody Loves Raymond". Frankly, I had
  no idea who Phil was until this show. I wouldn't say I have strong love for
  food shows (aside from binging baking competitions when I'm on vacation), so
  now that I've watched episodes for the two cities in their repertoire I cared
  about, I'm moving on.
* Street Food Asia
  * This was the first food documentary I watched on Netflix. I watched the
  Thailand one first. That was gripping. Man, if only I lived down the street
  from Jay Fai... I watched the Chiayi one next, just to reminisce a bit about
  Taiwan..
* Mad Men
  * I've been meaning to get into this show for some time, but never had easy
  access. Now I'm probably 10 episodes in and am kind of bored of Don and Betty
  and Peggy's daily lives. I'm sure I'll finish at some point...but I think I'd
  rather get back on The Wire, or maybe start the Sopranos?
* The Office (thanks to Gervais Principle)
  * Alright, so Venkatesh Rao's [Gervais
   Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/) is what get me
   to watch this show. I just wanted to see what it's all about. It's enjoyable,
   in the way that I'd expect a standard, post-2000s, well-received comedy
   [about nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) would be like. I'll
   keep it on the backburner, but don't expect me to go binge watching this
   show.
* Note: I've tried Breaking Bad and I didn't like it. Frankly, I'm getting a bit
tired of the TV, so maybe throw some intellectual internet writing or books or
manga at me next?

Movies:
* 霸王別姬 -- 實在是太遺憾，我在網上找到的版本是被切短的，最後那畫面都被割斷...
等到...得去圖書館尋整版再次享受那風光
* Saint Young Men

Now onto manga:
* Banana Fish
  * I was looking down the [MyAnimeList Top
  Manga](https://myanimelist.net/topmanga.php) list for something that was
  completed and intellectual, in the way that
  [my other manga picks](../../../books_readings.html) are, when I stumbled upon
  Banana Fish. I didn't expect much, but the reviews were strangely high, so I
  figured I'd check it out. Turns out it's an amazing story. I'm about 75% done,
  and am dying to see the resolution of this gripping crime story. I highly
  recommend this manga if you're looking for a story that will keep you i
  entertained but now down or spook you in the way that Monster or Pluto can.
* Adolf Ni Tsigu (Three Adolfs, Message to Adolf)
  * Just started this. It's an Osama Tezuka manga, so I expect great things.
* The plan for future manga reading is to go back and reread some of the
classics, like Pluto and Steel Ball Run.

I've also been working through Duolingo's Russian course. I'm supplementing that
with [this introductory site](http://www.russianlessons.net/) and this [site
with children's books](http://lit.lib.ru/a/abramcewa_n_k/text_0070.shtml).

Books:
* Design Patterns (Go4)
  * This book has really been a slog for me, but I'm sure it will pay dividends
  eventually...I have never particularly enjoyed reading about programming, but
  I have to eat my broccoli eventually.
* Alchemy of Finance and the Soros Lectures at the CEU
  * I don't remember who exactly pushed me over the edge into the boiling pot
  of philosophical posturing that is Soros. The Soros Lectures were reasonably
  easy to understand, but I figured I wanted something more meaty, something
  that would really explain how he made all his money. So I tried the Alchemy
  of Finance. And I'm not sure I got anything out of it. Well, I was introduced
  to the idea of
  [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory), but
  I can't say Soros' long-winded explanations actually provided much more
  value than the Wikipedia article. Maybe I'm just not smart enough, but
  frankly...I [still have no idea what the man
  does](https://bclund.com/2014/08/20/nothing-can-learn-george-soros/).
* 三體
  * I tried slogging through this in college and got bored. I'm slogging through
  it again now, and ... still I'm bored, but I feel invested enough to at least
  want to finish this first book of the trilogy. Maybe I should blame my boredom
  on the fact that I'm reading the Chinese version. The English version seems
  much more, well, brisk.

And finally onto all the other Internet articles I've been forcing down my
throat in an attempt to educate myself and appear semi-intellectually unique
and interesting when I expose my thoughts on Twitter and in preparation for
the day when we can all finally face each other in person again:
* [Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/)
* Epsilon Theory
* [BGP Lamport article](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs174/byzantine.pdf)
  * I still don't fully understand some of the claims but I'm exhausted from
  working through the algorithms and proofs.
  [Here's a good resource with
  code and examples](https://marknelson.us/posts/2007/07/23/byzantine.html)
* [Lisp Koans](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans)
  * I've worked through probably 24 of them at this point.

Exercise metrics I'm trying to keep track of. All numbers are for one set. Unless
otherwise noted, all numbers are unweighted (I don't have anything heavy enough
at home...):
* 12-14 military push up
* 10-12 spiderman push ups
* 4 - 6 faux planche push ups
* 8 - 10 skater squats per leg x 2
* 8 - 10 pistol squats per leg x 2
* 8 - 10 SLDLs per leg x 2
* 30 basic squats / sumo squats / skiier squats
* 25x lunge squats
* L sit hold +10 seconds
* As many tricep dips as seconds I held the L sit for.
* 3 - 5 assisted pull ups
* 20 reps kettle bell swings (25 - 30lb)
* 30 reps standing russian twist (25 - 30lb)
* Split squat jumps
* Bounded jump and hops

If you need exercise inspiration, I highly recommend checking out [Coach
Wheel's](https://twitter.com/CoachWheel) Twitter feed. He was by far my
favorite coach in high school (strength and conditioning) and is always happy
to give advice on nutrition / exercise over DM.
