I believe the fundamental human pursuit is happiness.

> Unalienable rights: Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

The best theory of happiness I have see so far is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's
[*Flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Flow is achieved
when challenge matches skill. Flow is the happiness we are looking for.

The prevailing business theory is that every business, every product,
everything must have a job. Everything must exist to fulfill some need or
desire. Your computer helps you get work done, helps you restock household
supplies, keeps you entertained, etc. Your washing machine helps you clean
your clothes efficiently. Your friends keep you entertained and help take
care of you. Whatever you create, whatever you do, then, must fulfill some
need or desire. Or so the thinking goes.

I think the more fundamental objective is to make people happy by helping
them achieve flow. Let's look at a couple of products and brands that people
"love". Let's also look at the idea of "saving time and money". [That's an
idea that I don't think is going to change](https://medium.com/@seansheikh/bezos-wisdom-focus-on-the-things-that-dont-change-f3fc39eca401).

First, Costco. People LOVE Costco. *I* love Costco, even though it doesn't
make sense for me to shop there. I love Costco for pretty much the same
reasons everybody else does: unbeatable, convenient deals. Making the
decision to shop at Costco is a low effort, low skill decision. Sure, maybe
you need to do a little budgeting to account for all the extra "deals" you
will be picking up at the store, but the $50 membership fee is easily
recouped, especially if you buy higher ticket items like vacation and rental
cars through the company. Costco also helps people save time and money.

Why is saving time and money so important? It's not just because Bezos,
with his infinite wisdom, pronounced it important. My hunch is that it's
because time and money are hard to recoup. To be clear, time is impossible to
recoup. Money is definitely recoupable, but the general consensus about work
is that it's a drag, so it's best to consider money as a difficult to recover
resource. This doesn't explain everything, though. How does the difficulty,
or impossibility, of recouping these items have to do with flow and happiness?
Time is impossible to recover, so one can never achieve flow against
time. Money is difficult to recoup, and decreases in wealth can mean painful
lifestyle changes, so the challenge of making money can exceed many people's
skill levels.

When things are too hard, people get frustrated. When things are too easy,
people get bored. Dealing with the expenditure of time and money is something
that tends to get people frustrated. Helping them manage the flow with a more
manageable amount of challenge puts them back into a flow state. Another way
to think about this is perhaps that helping people save time and money means
allowing them to spend those resources on other flow-inducing activities.
Saving $1,000 on vacation means they have another $1,000 to use on video games
or another vacation, or gardening. Saving an hour of time by booking through
Costco means you have another hour to play Call of Duty with or read a book
or watch an episode of Games of Thrones in. Saving time and money is so
effective a strategy because they are such obnoxious resources for us to
manage.

Next, Google. The sentiment towards Google has changed with all the issues
around privacy and censorship in China and AMP, etc, but Google is still a
service that people cannot live without. Why has Google and its related
products, like YouTube, done so well? Google made searching for information
exceedingly low effort. Low challenge, low skill? That's a flow match. YouTube
made searching for videos and storing videos and sharing videos super smooth.
Anybody can set up a vlog, or a personal online video store. But Google
also saves its users and customers time and money. Google is likely the most
efficient search engine on the internet. DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc, have all
improved their search results, but you're likely to get where you want the
fastest when using Google. Even if that's not the case, the reputation is so
strong that switching costs will override most attempts to leave Google.
Google is also a hugely effective advertiser. You get insane reach with just a
couple of dollars spent on your text ad for mesothelioma claims services.
Google has made our lives more delightful by making difficult, non-flow tasks
like research and advertising and video entertainment so much easier.

Third, Amazon. You know Amazon's logo is [hiding a smile](http://www.vmastoryboard.com/case-stories/2648/turner_duckworth_amazon_smile_logo/#sthash.3ThdO933.dpbs), right? Amazon has been delighting customers for over 20 years now. You
can track the happiness metric by looking at the amount of money that flows
into their coffers every year. People spend so much money and time on Amazon
because it's the ultimate online shopping destination. It super easy to
find what you want, and it's super easy, with 1-click ordering, to get what
you want. Over the years, they've expanded their offerings into cloud
services, movies, fashion, groceries, music, so now you can get even more of
what you want, sometimes before you know you want it (those darn
recommendation algorithms), at amazing prices and low effort. Low challenge,
low effort, saving time and money? All the boxes have been checked.

Perhaps there's a bit of a spurious saving time and money kind of thing going
on here. It may be the case that we are saving time and money on
individual transactions at Amazon or Costco or Google but are spending
more in aggregate. We love going to Costco so much that we end up spending
10% more on toilet paper each year. "But it's so cheap and you get 50 rolls
of premium, 40-ply at a time!" We love shopping on Amazon so much that we end
up spending 50% more on Christmas gifts through the site each year. "Oh,
but where else was I going to get those wooden coasters for Uncle Joe for
such a great price and free 2-day shipping?" It's so easy to spend time on
Google searching for things that we now spend 20% more time doing "research"
on Google, browsing the web through Google, that we would have without it.
I don't want to make any false claims about this kind of behavior being
harmful. I just want to bring up the idea that our accounting for the new
behaviors these services encourage may not exactly add up the way we expect.

Fourth, dating sites. We've talked about time and money as being prime
examples of things that we aren't usually in flow states when dealing with.
But what about that other huge cause of anxiety? Relationships. It's so easy
to meet new people, to have friends, when you're forced together in a place
with social expectations like school. Once you leave school, your social
and romantic interactions are completely left up to your discretion. It was
hard enough to get to know people in school. Now you have to find them *and*
get to know them. Dating services like Tinder or eHarmony or Match.com help
resolve this issue with relatively low effort, relatively low skill required.
You save time and money! Now you can sit at home and save up your energy and
money for dates with matches!

I've pushed this flow as happiness concept hard in this post, but I think the
idea stands up to the evidence. Great brands, great companies, great services,
etc, certainly do solve people's needs. But the reason they've got such a
strong hold on people is because they create happiness through flow. They
ask for little effort and little skill to make life easier, especially to
relieve people of great burdens regarding time, money, and emotional energy.

Questions, comments, etc, can be sent to my inbox~.

In my next post, I want to talk about passive income strategies. One of the
points I hope to explore is the idea of things that people find repeated value
in. Flow and happiness is definitely tied to my understanding of repeated
value, so I also want to develop my understanding of those concepts.
See you next time.
