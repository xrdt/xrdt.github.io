Today's post is about knowing when to stop, giving up, when you've made
enough progress for the day, when to push, how much harder to push, and 
all that jazz that would be valid answers to the Jeopardy question: 
"When is enough enough?" 

I consider this question to be hugely fundamental to my life because 
time is an irrecoverable resource and because I want to minimize emotional 
frustration that leads to burnout <a href="#1down" id="1up">[1]</a>. 

Before we begin, I'd like you to read Jeff Bezos' [2017 shareholder's letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm). 

What I like about Bezos is that he gave two very easy ingredients for achieving high standards: 
recognition and scope. "First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that 
domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it 
will take) to achieve that result â€“ the scope." Some of you may be dismissive and say this is 
"obvious". I'd challenge you to think about whether you could have come up with as precise a set of 
criteria that covered most of the same knowledge space, before you read Bezos' definition. If you 
couldn't have, his insight was *not* obvious. I am likely to be missing some criterion for what's 
obvious and what's not, so please send feedback if this paragraph intellectually aggravates you. 

One could adapt the same criteria for knowing when to give up. First know what the outcome should 
look like. Second, know how long it should take you to achieve that outcome. If you exceed that 
expected time, you should reassess whether you 

The problem with this assessment of when to give up, I think, 

Never give up on a dream just because of the length of it will take to accomplish it. The time will 
pass anyway. -- H. Jackson Brown

<p>From my own experience, burnout is primarily emotional. Time spent is a 
side-effect.</p>

<p>It's not how many hours you work, it's how much of your experience 
involves despair, frustration, and resentment. That might either be 
towards your employer ("stupid schedules, I'm not valued"), towards 
yourself ("this should be easy but I'm failing"), or towards the universe 
for simply not being the way it "should" be. </p>
