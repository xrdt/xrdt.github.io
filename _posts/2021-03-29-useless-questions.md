How do you explain a concept to someone who has no way of experiencing that concept?
 - How do you explain physical pain to an alien species that does
   not experience physical pain?
 - How do you explain a [shadow to a blind man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYLAKYNVX8)?
 - How do you translate the
 [untranslatable](https://www.theintrepidguide.com/untranslatable-words-ultimate-list/)?
 (again, I need a post about the power of labels to create a [feedback
 loop](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1207411521392803840)
 between how the word modulates your thinking about the world and how well you
 think the word represents your understanding of the concept you're trying to
 label.

Answer: You can't, because [Richard Feynman said
so](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-richard-feynman-on-why-he-can-t-tell-you-how-magnets-work).
There are certain concepts that cannot be explained from the [lowest level of
first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).
Either you accept some base axiom upon which to build the rest of your
thinking or you abandon that line of thought.

From an energy conserving perspective, I, and my tired brain, would like to ask
others to abstain from asking this question. From the perspective of someone
looking to push the limits of their ability to express themselves in a language
(or to [reverse the ossification of language
patterns](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1091287428948623360) they keep at
the tip of their tongue), this question is perhaps not entirely a waste of time.
