I was at the ArtCenter College of Design for a conference once. It was a
pretty neat conference; the only issue was that I was extremely sleep deprived
and therefore exceedingly antsy. At some point, I even snuck into their
library and got hooked on
[Ayako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_(manga)). Anyway, the "cool story"
of this post is that one of ArtCenter's water dispensers dispenses water at
such a low temperature that that the water freezes in your bottle. I no longer
have the photo of the brick of ice that appeared in my Nalgene, but I'm sure
you know what I mean.
