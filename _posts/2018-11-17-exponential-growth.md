Economics, I’m telling you, all they talk about is rationality<br>
Having multiple optionality isn’t computational insanity<br>
Because we all living in hyper-reality<br>
Our brains as good as cyborgs, this is the new age of humanity<br>

Gotta think in terms of opportunity cost, margins, incentive theory<br>
Markets are the best way to maximize our collective productivity<br> Productivity optimization is our calling, let’s not get confused, homie<br>
The government wants to maximize GDP, get us all to take responsibility<br>
Incentivize us with low interest, tax breaks, this is the land of opportunity<br>

Don’t you see it, sometimes we follow Friedman, sometimes follow Keynes<br>
Every regime is different, but the long-run behavior is the same<br>
We all looking for exponential growth, hockey stick, it goes by different names<br>
Unsustainable you say, that’s the name of the game<br>
We fighting a losing battle against entropy, can’t give up, that’s lame<br>
Every so often we have a revolution, spark non-linearity, don’t disdain<br>
The power of the human mind, we on a roll, follow the gain<br>

We limited by our capital so we invented debt<br>
Let you use more than you own isn’t that a risky bet<br>
So the debt owners they charge usury some high numbers they like to set<br>
But don’t worry I’m responsible ain’t no credit card regret<br>
Take a look at 2008, people losing homes moving to Tibet<br>
Just a phenomenon of the credit cycle is what they want you to think is correct<br>
Cycles are inevitable, we humans aren’t stable like computer chipsets<br>
But what if we didn’t use money move beyond give and get<br>

We now limited by our attention, by our time<br>
No longer have to work with nature, get covered in grime<br>
We pretend we getting closer with everybody when we’re online<br>
But all we really doing is turning our brains into slime<br>
They say the world’s at our fingertips<br>
Just ask Google and you will receive a box of top hits<br>
But don’t you know searching can’t replace understanding<br>
The human mind needs deep stimulation before it’s thriving<br>
That’s why we value creativity and imagination<br>
Reveal our ingenuity make things better for the next generation<br>

That’s where the real exponential growth lies<br>
Help us transcend the present move up into the skies<br>
Life is too short to waste open your eyes<br>
Take control of your mind and body don’t you realize<br>
No limits to your potential stop eating fries<br>
Your objective is to build upon previous generations it all jives<br>
With Newton standing on the shoulders of giants say your goodbyes<br>
To disease to suffering to inequality to depravity to cries<br>
For help<br>
Not Yelp<br>
But kelp<br>

Think about how you want to spend the rest of your life<br>
Pursue exponential growth for growth’s sake it’s a line of strife<br>
Gotta be sharp as a surgeon be quick with the knife<br>
Ain’t nobody blowing horns we all just playing the fife<br>

But remember what’s real in the world, what makes you happy<br>
Think about humanity, your humanness, this ain’t sappy<br>
Emotions are good caring is good compassion is good say hi to your pappy<br>
Get out there, see the world, create value for society<br>
Real value you can see, touch people, that’s reality<br>
This is the real exponential growth, growth of humanity<br>
