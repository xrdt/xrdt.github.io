This is basically the sunrise BLT that used to be on Caltech’s breakfast menu.

Two slices lightly pan toasted bread (I like [wheat](https://www.amazon.com/Daves-Killer-Bread-Grains-Organic/dp/B00U10OTTW/ref=asc_df_B00U10OTTW/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312196386946&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5985498439811784729&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031119&hvtargid=pla-570211486545&psc=1))
Two eggs over hard (I like over hard, but to each his own)
Chopped lettuce
Two slices heirloom tomato (any large tomato will do)
Sliced avocado (¼ Haas works nicely)
Two strips bacon (cook it to the border of crispy and soft)

This would be my go-to order for any day I got up early enough for breakfast
at school. The creaminess of the avocado nicely blends in with the slight
sweetness of the wheat. Eggs are delicious and help pad out the sandwich.
Bacon adds the salt, tomato adds some juice, and lettuce packs crunch and
cleans up any excess flavor. Overall a very wholesome meal to start the day
with.
