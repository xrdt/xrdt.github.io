I cannot stand people who are restlessly under-entertained. I’m talking about those people who are constantly fidgeting, looking at their phone, reaching for their phone, opening their computer to check FB, switching tabs to check FB, etc. I want people to be bored. Appreciate the pain and stress of boredom because it should be getting you to do something more worthwhile with your life than watch everybody else’s lives go by.
