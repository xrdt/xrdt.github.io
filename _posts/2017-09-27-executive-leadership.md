s the first meeting for the [Caltech Student Investment Fund](http://sif.caltech.edu/) 2017 - 2018 executive board members. We laid out our meeting schedule for the year and discussed our plan for making this year better than the last. We were quite ambitious last year, and launched a variety of initiatives that largely ended up half-baked due to lack of time and interest. Some useful relics remain, like our new website and the [series of slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8xg0BH1sKPLS24zZWM0bExhXzg?usp=sharing) on investing that I created. I also invited a bunch of speakers to help supplement our weekly discussions, which drew quite a bit of interest, especially from new members. 

This year, we plan to continue with our speaker series and to reestablish our industry connections. We will reach out to DFA, Western Asset, and PIMCO for company visits and other connections for speakers. It is our responsibility to educate and support our members, and making sure they know where to look for jobs is extremely important. We still haven’t solved the education problem, but I’m sure we’ll find some way to make the meetings useful and worthwhile for everyone who attends. 

Frequent communication is extremely important. I recommend biweekly or monthly meetings for executive teams, because that’s enough time for serious progress to be made on high-level objectives and frequent enough to pivot if things start heading south. We neglected to maintain a consistent schedule last year, which is partly why our operations unraveled. A new year brings new resolve, though common sense says that enthusiasm isn’t enough to carry the tide. Dedication and process are also important to establishing lasting habits. And I believe habits are the best force to fight against our inclinations to procrastinate, be late, flake, and demonstrate irresponsibility.

今天的新詞：吳儂軟語

我已經好久沒寫中文日記了，真不好意思。我最因為開學而覺得非常煩惱，時間跑去哪躲起來了啊？不果，我寫 blog 是一種非常重要的責任，我一定要持續的負責任。

你們有可能猜的出來今天的新詞從哪裏學來的吧？我最近因為放棄「天意」那本書又試著讀「台北人」。台北人的第一章散文講一位從蘇州來的尹雪艷。她說話的方式有一次被稱為吳儂軟語。讀了[這一篇](https://kknews.cc/news/5pxk2l.html)才懂這個短語的語源。蠻有趣的知識。

今天的過程蠻正常，但從學校開始三天已經過去了。忙的時候時間就過得越快。這有好有壞，太忙就是沒時間去想無聊的事，但是你最好的主義可能在你最無聊的時刻誕生。所以你還是盡量每天都放開一點時間去思索或靜坐，這不只是對你腦筋有幫助、也是對你身體有好處喔。

我最近發現了一些調整身體錯位的短片。我幾天前開始每天做這些動作，已經發現我平常的活動比較輕鬆。我推薦你們從這片開示：[http://www.sonima.com/fitness/hip-alignment/](http://www.sonima.com/fitness/hip-alignment/)
