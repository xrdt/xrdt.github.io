Here are some threads which I've been thinking about for a while but haven't managed to consolidate 
into a blog post. 

* When do you give up? 
   * Bezos' letter gives a pretty good start to this question by forcing you to distinctly describe 
     what you are trying to achieve and to place a time table on your desired achievement. 
* Never give up on a dream because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass 
  anyway. 
* Work on things that make you happy, regardless of what other people say about them. 
* Figure out the price of success and pay it. 
* Don't get distracted by people who are playing a different game from you. (I have a post about 
  this, but I somehow keep needing to remind myself of this.)
* How you live each day is how you live your life. 
* Optimize for relationships. Choose the opportunities that will maximize your likelihood of 
  building lasting, meaningful relationships (e.g. college) because people are everything.
* Optimize for happiness. The key criterion for living a good life is to want to be alive. 
* I'm not afraid of the work. I'm more afraid of not having good people to work with. 
* Next time you want to procrastinate, think hard about what you would be doing instead of what you 
  should be doing. 
* There is always hope. Even if there is no hope for you, there must be hope for someone else in 
  the world. 
* It's always a good time to be alive. 
* Don't do work after sundown. 
* YOu should build a place in your house that is used for relaxation and recuperation.
