Change the world by changing people.

Change people by changing the way they spend their time.

Change the way they spend their time by rethinking their life workflows.

Amazon has reworked our workflow for shopping and browsing.

Google has reworked our workflow for information retrieval.

The iPhone reworked our workflow for how we interface with each other and the Internet.

The computer reworked the information worker’s workstation and thus their daily workflow.

Home automation in the form of dishwashers and laundry machines and showers and vacuums reworked housewives’ workflows.

Github reworked the programmer’s workflow.

The car, the plane, the train, all reworked our travel workflows.

Emerald Cloud Labs is going to change biologists’ and chemists’ workflows by abstracting away lab technology.

Thoughtspot is changing business intelligence by empowering every one in an organization to make discovering the answers to data-driven questions a part of their workflow.

Zipline transforms medical care by reworking the delivery and receipt of critical supplies like blood and vaccines.

Technology transforms our lives because it transforms the ways we live our lives. It changes the way we spend our time. It forces us to change the focus of our fields of vision. It changes our priorities. Hopefully, it helps to focus more on actually important priorities.
