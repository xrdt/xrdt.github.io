Greatness is achieved by those with the ambition to reach for their dreams. They were kicked down by nearly every other person who took a look at them, but they persisted in showing the world their worth. It is these people, who live in the margins of society, who have the guts and the vision to make the world a better place.

Their attitude must be cultivated among everybody, even those who prefer to live in the mainstream and prefer a stable lifestyle. Innovation is a responsibility of society.


Here are some papers discussing the increase in corporate power that is part of the complacent class phenomenon that Tyler Cowen identifies in his book of the same name.

Innovation and disruption and breakthroughs cannot be designated responsibilities of “Innovation Labs” or “Innovation Centers”. Every person must be constantly fighting for ways they can use their talents and abilities to build a better future.
