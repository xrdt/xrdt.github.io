I just finished watching a [great
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8) with Peter Thiel and
Peter Robinson on Thiels' 2007 essay [The Straussian Moment](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay).
Below are my notes from the interview:
* We've shifted away from believing the weakness of the will and power of
the intellect (sinful bastards) to believing in the strength of the will
and the weakness of the intellect (people are generally good but individuals
shouldn't have intellecutal agency. We believe in the wisdom of crowds and
AI and automation.). This shift started with the Enlightenment because
people were sick and tired of fighting bloody, long wars over fundamental
and intractable issues of human nature and what a well-lived life is and
what happens after death. The easiest way to prevent these battles from
erupting is just to not talk about these thing in polite company. Intsead,
we can become apathetic and inward looking and release our energies
in virtual medium like video games and movies and amuse ourselves to death.
Meanwhile, the non-Western world, that wasn't influenced by the anthesthetic
that was the Enlightenment continues to battle with their Gods and
fundamentalism and identity and now wants to fight against a Godless and
ideology-less and sterile West for dominance over a world that has strayed
from God (ahem the Middle East).
  * There is some sense that we know that modern politics is kayfabe, but
    whatever! It's entertaining!
* Thiel's objective since...I don't know, 2000? has been to respark
technological progress. One of his major framings is that we landed on the
moon in July 1969. Three weeks later, Woodstock started. That, you could
argue, was the beginnig of the end for technological progress. The hippies
and drug culture and yoga and meditation and all the other inward facing
activities would dominate over production and outward facing activities.
The real end was the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. Thiel argues that a lot of
the scientific dynamism of the 19th century was from concrete and heated
competition with foreign powers. Apollo-Soyuz was basically a treaty. If
we're no longer fighting with each other, what's the point of putting in 80
hour weeks? The motivating factor was removed. You can read more about
Thiel's theory of stalling scientific progress
[here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/KcAjdgamYDudXN2Ez). There is another
potential reason for a stalling of scientific progress. If you accept that
much of the reason for scientific progress is comes from fighting and the
military, once we have enough weaponry to destroy the world 10x over,
there's no point in building more powerful weapons.
* China. Everybody's favorite topic~.
  * Peter Thiel reckons the West has a 6-12 month lead on China. That is, the
  West is still more innovative than China. China is largely copying the
  West, but since 6-12 months isn't much of a lead, the West really has a
  hound on its heels. The example Thiel gives here is that most new AI
  research is coming out of the West (DeepMind, OpenAI, etc).
  * What's screwy about the US to China trade deficit is that normally,
  capital should flow from developed to developing countries. Part of this
  is that you should get better returns on money in the developing country.
  Another part is that you can view the developing country's deficit as
  how they are financing their growth. It's pretty backwards that Chinese
  peasants want to own low-yielding US bonds instead of investing in their
  own country's growth and development.
  * Thiel doesn't think that either the US or China thinks it will win this
  standoff. China is dealing with demographic collapse, financial capital
  flight, and human capital flight, among other things. The US is facing its
  decline as a world power. So, even if this standoff does end, it will be
  a Pyrric victory for whoever remains standing.
  * Another way a bunch of people massively screwed up on China was by believing
  that China would go the way of the Asian tigers and go democratic once it
  got rich. Henry Rowen made a 1996 prediction that by 2015 China would become
  democratic. Totally wrong. Thiel's take on this was that China learned a
  very different lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the
  Soviet Union than all the rose colored Western intellectuals. They took from
  those incidents how to not let their socialist / communist / non-capitalist /
  non-democratic panopticon collapse. Western pundits overdetermined the problem
  of a country becoming democratic. There was never anything deterministic
  about that process.
* Trump. Everybody's second favorite topic~.
  * According to Thiel, one of the major considerations for the administration
  is whether they can maintain GDP growth over the next decade.
* Thiel says he sees three foresees very chilling but deterministic futures:
(1) Islamic Sharia Law; (2) Totalitarian AI Panopticon; (3)
Hyperenvironmentalism. I can see (1) emerging as a result of the
unwilligness of the apathetic, non-religious, non-political, amused to death
West to fight against the highly charged, "we have a clear enemy" radical
Islamists. (2) makes me think about the Singularity and how even typically
optimistic techies turn apocalyptic in the face of a super power AI that
we can no longer understand or control. (2) also makes me think about
surveillance, especially the level of surveillance (abuse of, would you
say?) technologies deployed and leveraged in China for manipulation of
[Common Knowledge](https://www.epsilontheory.com/tag/common-knowledge-game/)
that doesn't seem to have been documented as as aggressive a threat in the
West. (3) is the most calm and most desirable of the three futures, but it
certainly doesn't seem to have the same ability to draw the media's
attention.
* Advice for younger Thiel.
  * Education is not a substitute for the future or for hard thinking about
  what you want the future to concretely look like.
  * Try to avoid playing in hypercompetitive areas, like becoming a lawyer.
* I have this sense that, as interesting and intellectually capable as an
interviewer may be, most of them don't get very deep into the topics discussed.
Most have some agenda of X topics they want to get through before time runs out
and drift more into "now let me ask this pointed question to cross this line off
that list" rather than engaging with the topic at hand. I've noticed Eric
Weinstein doesn't do this. Rather,
[Eric](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563) does an
excellent job of just getting into the meat of things and holding on until he's
satisfied himself. [Shaan Puri and Sam
Parr](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-first-million/id1469759170) seem
to do this by design. A lot of of their episodes are just them chatting with
each other about whatever's interesting, so there's less of a need to do some
intellectual posturing to make the podcast hit the right tones for whatever
high brow audience is listening.
