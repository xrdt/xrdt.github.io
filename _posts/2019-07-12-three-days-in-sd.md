A couple of days before graduation (June 14, 2019), I took a trip with two Caltech friends down to 
San Diego. We rented a car from Hertz for a few days (thank you AAA for waiving young driver fees!)
and headed out at 9am from Caltech on Sunday. But apparently 9am was a really early departure 
time...both my friends were asleep for pretty much the entire ride down. I took the 210 then the 5
down until about Fashion Island. Once we got to that point, I took HWY 1 until I couldn't, then 
got back on the 5. Note: the nicest part of the 5 is the section from San Clemente to San Onofre. 
The road quality and views are the best along this strip. We hit a bit of traffic around Oceanside. 
I made the mistake of becoming upset at the traffic and taking surface streets to the next exit. We 
gained zero time from my frustration. The total driving time was something like 3 hours. 

We ate lunch with my parents at the [Argyle Steakhouse](http://www.argylesteakhouse.com/), a 
beautiful restaurant that's next to the [Aviara Golf Club](http://www.golfaviara.com/) and 
[Batiquitos Lagoon](http://www.batiquitosfoundation.org/). After lunch, we took a short walk along 
the Batiquitos Lagoon trail (too hot, forgot sunscreen), then headed to Encinitas for [Handel's 
Ice Cream](https://handelsicecream.com/). My sister has been raving about Handels' for forever, 
so now that I had the time and means to get to one, I was for sure going. I was no disappointed. 
Their ice cream is amazing. They have a huge board full of flavors, so you can go ham trying 
everything from [Snappy Turtle](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/handels-homemade-ice-cream-encinitas?select=RjYUiJxbogLXBAFkyMPmdQ) to Graham Central Station (would recommend this flavor. It's what 
I got) to Buckeye. Don't be fooled by the sizing, though. A "single" scoop is actually three 
massive scoops. The cones are fresh, but the ice crea melts fast, so you'll probably have a less 
messy time if you order a cup.

After Handel's, we walked on over to Moonlight Beach, where we enjoyed the sun, water, and wind 
for a couple hours. Moonlight Beach is a very lively beach. I would definitely recommend you check 
it out if you end up with time on your hands in North County San Diego. A popular restaurant near 
the beach is [Leucadia Pizzeria](https://leucadiapizza.com/). They've got pretty solid pies and 
pastas. The whole of Encinitas downtown is pretty swell, too, so if you have time, definitely go 
check out the [Self-Realization Fellowship](http://www.encinitastemple.org/visiting/) and 
[Hansen's](https://www.hansensurf.com/) (surf shop with ski / snowboard simulator in the back). 

After Moonlight, we headed home for a couple of hours of billiards and then dinner at 
[Teri Cafe](http://tericafe.com/). Teri Cafe is a simply wonderful Japanese cafe out in Oceanside. 
They serve massive, delicious portions of teriyaki, ramen, sushi, etc at unbeatable prices. 
Definitely try them out if you are in the area. 

That evening, we bought tickets for the USS Midway and planned to meet up with some friends from 
Caltech who were also planning to be at the ship the next morning. We planned to get up early in 
the morning and arrive at the Midway by 10am, its opening time. That plan failed...partly because 
people got up later than expected and partly because I had a last minute report to submit..(you can 
see the report [here](../../../Hexapod, Final Report.pdf). Anyway, we ended up leaving past ten. 
Traffic was light, but we had a bit of issue finding parking near the Midway (I think I was just 
blind to the entrance to the Midway parking lot) so we looped to some other parking lot. Really, 
I think the pro strat on parking in downtown SD is to just use free parking from Balboa Park
and take a scooter or Uber to wherever you want to go. 

We found the other Caltech kids, who had been on the ship since 10am...(like responsible people, 
they hinted) and spent the next five or six hours on the ship. There is a ton to look at on this 
ship, especially if you care about aviation and boats and the navy and all that jazz. We didn't 
even have time to look at the lower decks or listen to all the snippets about each of the aircraft.
There are lots of volunteers on the ship, who will talk your ear off about the ship and their time 
in the military, so do take advantage of all that you can on this boat. There are also scheduled 
presentations on things like the catapult system that you can pop a squat for (make sure to bring 
sun protection and food / water). By the time we did the island tour, though, we were all starving. 
One person threatened to collapse if we didn't find food, like, now...

We took a couple of Lyft scooters (best deal at $.15/min) over to 
[Tacos El Cabron](http://www.elcabron.net/), a taco shop in the Gaslamp District. 
This taco shop was pretty expensive, probably over $4 per taco (small taco), 
but it did the trick. We zoomed back to our cars on scooters after the meal and then went over 
to [Balboa Park](https://www.balboapark.org/). We walked from the 
[Organ Pavilion](https://www.balboapark.org/performing-arts/spreckels-organ) parking lot to the 
fountain outside the [Fleet Science Center](https://www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/parks/regional/missionbay/fiestaisland) 
then did a loop around the [Spanish Village Art Center](https://spanishvillageart.com/) before the 
other two Caltech kids headed off. They were just here for a day trip. We did a loop around the 
desert garden (found a homeless guy setting up camp among he cacti), the rose garden, took a couple 
of silly pictures in the Pepper Grove playground, and then headed off to Mission Bay for a loop and 
a half around [Fiesta Island](https://www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/parks/regional/missionbay/fiestaisland). 
I find it funny how I used to hate going to Balboa Park with my parents but now think Balboa Park 
is such a gem and central attraction of the city. I suppose this is one of those pieces of 
"perspective" you pick up as you get older. Fiesta Island is not all that exciting of an island...
but you can certainly find a good time on 
[Tecolote Shores](https://www.californiabeaches.com/beach/tecolote-shores-park-on-mission-bay/) or 
at [SeaWorld](https://www.californiabeaches.com/beach/tecolote-shores-park-on-mission-bay/)! To 
wrap up the evening, we went to chow down some [Torpastas](https://www.torpasta.com/). Torpastas
are pasta sandwiches. I highly recommend the pesto sandwich~. 

That was it for day two. 

Day three, we got up nice and early for an 10am facial~. One of our group members was upset about 
the idea of doing a facial so declined...(not surprising, honestly). After the facial, we rushed 
to my sister's school for the post-graduation festivities. After that, we zoomed over to 
[Carillo Ranch](http://carrillo-ranch.org/) to buy a beautiful postcard and then went to [VG's 
donuts](http://carrillo-ranch.org/) for the best donuts I have had in my life. Their dought is 
so tender, so fluffy, and the glaze is just the right amount of sweetness. I highly recommend 
their plain glazed donuts. The other donuts are pretty good, but the plain glazed are absolutely 
the top of the line at this shop. Do be careful about the time you visit them, though. They seem 
to take a midday break in baking, so you will either need to go before 11am or after school lets 
out. We got there at 2pm, so I had to settle for the only donut that was left...the powdered sugar 
circle. They only take cards for transactions above $10 (that is a lot of donuts). Once we complete 
the donut run, we raced off for Five Guys...somewhere along the way. Turns out I forgot to get 
a second postcard, so we made an emergency stop in Dana Point for a postcard and Five Guys. After 
that, we rushed back onto the 5 to try to get to the Hertz in Pasadena before closing at 6. We had 
to take a couple of toll roads to make it back in time. Even with the benefit of the toll roads 
(something like a $7 charge), we barely made it to the Hertz in time. Google's *awful* ETA system 
kept pushing back the ETA as we were driving. The guy who arrived at the Hertz just after us had 
the doors locked on him by a disgruntled employee....:0. The employee deliberately locked the doors 
behind him to prevent the rushed customer from getting into the store and placing a claim on his 
right to be serviced. 

Well, that was the end of that. The weather in Pasadena that day was surprisingly hot...we 
burned for tens of minutes on the side of Colorado Blvd while we waited for our Uber to take us 
back to campus.

There is much more to San Diego than what we were able to explore. Email me if you have questions 
about what's worth seeing or if you want help making an itinerary.

San Diego is a pretty car-dependent city, but you can certainly take the Coaster or Amtrak and local 
buses to get around...I just think you'll find your transportation times getting jacked way up if 
you try to rely on public transport. Of course, downtown, you have the benefit of the scooters. 
Uber and Lyft are reliable and broadly used, so you don't need a car, but I think you'll find your 
experience much improved if you have a vehicle.

Until next time.
