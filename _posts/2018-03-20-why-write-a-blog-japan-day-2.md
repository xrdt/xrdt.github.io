I'm writing this post in Fukuoka, Japan. I will be in Japan for the week and
then in Taiwan for the week after this, up until 3/31. I will be on Kyushu
for the entirety of my stay in Japan. I am traveling with Signet Tours.
Signet Tours really is an excellent tour company. They really take care of
their customers, from food to accommodations to the buses to the experiences.
The tour guides and the company will all willingly do their best to fulfill
any of your special requests. The tour guides are all very competent and
knowledgeable and responsible. I am sure you will find very little to
complain about regarding things the company is in charge of if you go on a
tour with them.

I've always been disappointed by standard Japanese food you can get in the
basements of department stores. Granted, this isn't high quality food, but I
assume it's what most Japanese eat on a daily basis, if they aren't cooking.

Before I continue with my complete disinterest in "real" Japanese food, let
me share some produce prices in USD, assuming a 100 JY/USD exchange rate:
1. Orange: $1 - $1.60
2. Cantaloupe: $82 - $330
3. Bananas: $3 for 5
4. Apple: ~$10
5. Strawberry: $15 for a pack of ~15

Some other produce was sold in sets. For example, a set of an apple, some
oranges, and some grapes, perhaps. I don't remember exactly the prices I saw,
but they aren't any less cheap than the prices I just shared.

Before I talk about today's disappointing department store meal, let me tell
you about yesterday's food experience.

Yesterday, since lunch was not included, I decided to try some Hakata ramen.
I have no idea about the rating of the place we tried, since it we just chose
some restaurant in the Canal City mall behind our hotel, but I am pretty sure
it was authentic. I was really hoping that I would get some amazingly
delicious bowl of ramen with fall-apart-in-your-mouth-and-perfectly-seasoned
chashu, but what I got was no better than what I've had at Shin-Sen-Gumi in
Rosemead. I don't like Shin-Sen-Gumi. I didn't like yesterday's ramen. I'm
sorely disappointed.

Today, dinner was no included, so we looked around the Tenjin Underground
Shopping Center for food. This underground center is really a wonderland.
It spans 12 streets north/south, and it probably has everything you could ever
want to buy. We ended up going to Daimaru, a Japanese department store for
our meal. Other people in our group split themselves up among conveyor belt
sushi and ramen and baked pigs feet. I wasn't particularly hungry, and two
circles around the department store food section didn't inspire any appetite,
so I gave up and bought a plain potato croquette and some yakitori.
My travel companions chose some other yakitori and some tonkatsu
(NOT TONKOTSU) bento and takoyaki. I don't like takoyaki, so I have no idea
how that tasted, but the rest was uninspiring. Ah...I long for the taste of
Taiwan.

I feel like the Japanese foods I like all have to be bought at a restaurant
to be good:
1. Tonkotsu ramen (not sure how I feel about other ramen, since I love the
fatty saltiness of hakata ramen).
2. Katsu
3. Curry, especially with katsu
4. Eel rice
5. Nigiri and rolls

Japanese bread is also sad. There are piles upon piles of bakery as far as
the eye can see in Japan, but I have yet to see a Japanese bakery that arouses
any desire in me. Bread should have life to it. It should glow with freshness
and the life that the baker put into it. I feel like all the Japanese bread
I've seen has been dry and lifeless. Everybody's taste is different, but I
think some things about food presentation and quality are universal.

Now for some good things. I found raspberry Kit Kats again! This is by far
my favorite flavor of Kit Kat. The raspberry is so nicely strong against the
white chocolate base. This version is also not overwhelmingly sweet. I bought
some Beni Imo Kit Kats yesterday because it's a Kyushu special (I think), but
was sorely disappointed because it tasted nothing like purple potatoes. Beni
Imo was also insanely sweet. (Apologies for mixing the bad into the good
section).

Also, <img src="/Users/byang/desktop/BG/xrdt.github.io/_posts/images/soda_candy_amazing.jpeg" style="width: 200px;"/> the candy in the image is amazing!
It's so juicy and tasty. It's also limited edition, so I'll have to slowly
savor each piece.

I almost forgot to talk about the weather. Today was quite cold. We went out
to Yufuin, and it was probably near 30 deg Fahrenheit. Fukuoka, when it's
cold, is no loser to Hokkaido! The rain held itself together yesterday and
this morning, but we really got some water this evening. We spent most of our
time inside, so the weather was not a huge impediment to our travels.

------------------------------
Now to talk about why I write a blog. I felt recently that I should stop
writing to an audience and that my blog should just be for myself. A couple
days after I had that thought, I realized that I had little reason to record
interesting thoughts on my blog. By the time I have time to write my blog,
I've likely already satisfied my intellectual curiosity about whatever was
interesting to me that day and have nothing more to say on the topic. Thus,
the only real motivator for my writing my blog is the potential audience I
can reach. I don't know who that audience is, and I don't care right
now. All I need is to maintain this sense of purpose for an unidentified
audience while I write.
