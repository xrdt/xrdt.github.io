* GPA doesn't matter. It's a weak signal.
* Those trendy skill meters people put on their resumes? Meaningless. I know
DE Shaw asks something similar, but they make the ranking more meaningful by
asking for lines of code written in each language you claim proficiency in.
* The best way to get a job you want is to reach out to relevant people at
the company you're interested in on LinkedIn. Reach out to an engineering
manager or design lead or whoever could potentially be your manager and ask
for an informational interview. There are plenty of people out there who would
be interested in investing a little time to get to know you and help you
fill in gaps of your understanding about their company. If who you reached
out to is not willing to help, ask them to introduce you to someone who can
help.
* Always try to think of how you can help the company and how they can
help you. The relationship *must* be mutually beneficial. Typically, young
people don't have much clarity on where you can have the most impact or what
makes them happy at work. At the risk of falling into a trap of optionality,
you should try to find a place that will give you a good balance between
flexibility and structure. You want structure so you get good at what you're
assigned. You want flexibility to explore within the company and learn about
different functions in the business and potentially in the industry.
* *I* don't care what you dress in at a career fair, as long as it's clean
and doesn't have holes. This is a perk of the tech industry. *You should dress
up for an interview with a consulting or finance firm.* That's just how
business gets done.
* Ask critical questions. You should __never__ be afraid to ask hard questions.
Worst case, the company will tell you information is confidential. If they get
defensive or attack you for asking a tough question, you can immediately drop
any further conversation with them.
   * Figure out whether your living situation will be acceptable to you. This
   includes commute, your future roommates, your ability to maintain your
   current social connections, cost of living, weather, liveliness of the
   city you will be living in, etc. Make sure it is not something you will
   gripe about a month after you join.
   * What is the technical culture like? For this,
   [Joel's Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) is pretty comprehensive.
   * Do you think the people are high quality? Do you like the people? Do you
   like your future manager and future coworkers? You should come away from
   interviews feeling like you have things to learn from your coworkers and
   that they will invest in mentorship.
   * Do you trust the management? Do you think the vision for the company
   makes sense? Do you feel like you will be working on meaningful projects?
   * What is the turnover? This is especially important to ask if the
   company is small because long tenures from early employees shows that the
   company has been treating them well and that they believe in the company.
   It also shows that the team gels well and that they like the quality of
   work they have been producing.
   * What is the path to yes? I am pulling this from
   [Bob Baxley](https://medium.com/front-conference/designing-the-machine-that-designs-the-designs-by-bob-baxley-3bde2061ac6d),
   ThoughtSpot's new SVP of design and experience. This question is getting
   at operations and internal process. How easy is it to push new initiatives
   * Is there clear direction in the company? Is it clear where the company
   is going and why? Does that high level vision translate cleanly into
   work for individual engineers?
  from bottom up?
   * [Tell me about your worst day at this company](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20920272).
   It's a more straightforward way to understand what there could be to not
   like about the job.
   * Are the salary and benefits acceptable?
