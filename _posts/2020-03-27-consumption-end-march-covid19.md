I've been wanting to publicly share a list of what I've found interesting
for some time now, but I've found it exceedingly hard to keep tracking of
everything I read and watch. Since we're now in week 2 of COVID-19 shelter
in place in the Bay, I've quickly ramped up my desire for online entertainment
and begun consuming Netflix. Of course, Netflix isn't the only thing I'm consuming...see below for
the full list:

Netflix --
* [Dangal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film))
  * This is a well done movie that touches hard upon father-daughter relationships and the belief parents can have in their
    children.
* [Ip Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man_(film))
  * This movie does a good job portraying the relationships between the people involved in the town and
    Ip Man's personal principles, especially when it comes time for him to stand up to the Japanese.
