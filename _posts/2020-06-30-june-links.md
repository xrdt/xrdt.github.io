Welcome to June, my friends. We are halfway through the year.

__Books__:
* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)
  * After months, no, maybe years of knowing about this book, I finally
  understand why some people read this little primer every year. The book is
  so simple, so intuitive, yet has so many little gems of quotes and pieces of
  perspective scattered throughout that it's worth devouring it all in one
  sitting once each year. [Here](../03/thinking-in-systems-quotes.html) are some
  quotes to pique your interest.
* [Confessions of the Pricing
Man](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Pricing-Man-Affects-Everything/dp/3319203991)
  * I got this book a few months ago, for free, from [The Waiter's
  Pad](https://thewaiterspad.com). I delayed reading it for so long because,
  well, you know, I'm BUSY! This is literally a book of cute anecdotes on price.
  I get pissed off while reading this because I don't feel like my brain is
  really going through some deep technical wringer that will dramatically
  enhance my life earnings / other material success, so I'm going to leave it
  half read and see if it improves enough with age to be worth picking up in the
  future.
* [Kitchen
Confidential](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=kitchen+confidential&qid=1591558074&s=books&sr=1-2)
  * I decided to finally (virtually) pick up this tome after reading another
  [whip-cracking honestly this is what the cruncher of big leagues professional
  cooking is like
  article](https://ruhlman.com/2010/09/20/so-you-wanna-be-a-chef-by-bourdain-2/?ck_subscriber_id=547821799)
  by Bourdain. It's good...as a sit by the pool with a just gripping enough but
  not too blood pressure raising book while on vacation read. He has a section
  on cooking tools and name drops a couple of famous cooking books, so if you
  actually want to get serious about upgrading your egg-frying equipment, you
  won't be entirely left to your own devices. I'm not yet convinced it's time
  for me to seriously up my cooking game, but my itch to sit down at the
  negotiating table and draw out the contract of "what kind of adult I want to
  be -- cooking edition" is only drawing nearer with every passing day. I love
  eating but I my hatred for paying restaurants to cook mediocre or just
  overpriced plates of mush or serve dry pastries to me is only growing, so
  perhaps this will be the summer I finally crack and fill my kitchens with
  beautiful little glass bowls for mise en place and shallots and King Arthur
  Flour and stainless steel "so heavy I will dent your face" sauce pans and
  Kerrygold butter and a "so sharp you'll cut yourself looking at it chef's
  knife" etc etc etc and fill the kitchen air with more than just the reek of
  slightly over-fried bacon and microwaved prepared meats from Costco.
* Still working on Dark Forest...Sorry, I'm a slow reader.
* [How Children
Fail](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021),
by John Holt
  * I've been wanting to read this book since junior year of high school
  (approx. 7 years now). That was when I somehow got caught up into the
  conspiracy theory of Obama being a African Muslim and Charlotte Iserbyt's
  [Dumbing Down of
  America](https://www.amazon.com/deliberate-dumbing-down-america-Chronological/dp/0966707109/ref=sr_1_1)
  and [John
  Gatto](https://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Schooling/dp/0865718547/ref=sr_1_1).
  For whatever reason, even though I chatted frequently with a college friend
  who is no longer with us about education and how I would want to educate my
  kids and why traditional education has irrevocably screwed with our brains and
  is largely insufficient, despite the fact that the proportion of intellectual
  elites has probably never changed, I never read this book. Now I have. My
  fervor for the points Holt makes about how schools destroy children's minds
  through constant application of fear and how the proper way to teach is to let
  children follow their own paths. The only way that knowledge will stick is if
  a person asks their own questions, rather than writing down on paper or
  parroting back answers to questions others have fed them. When you feed
  someone questions and answers, it's easy to for them to remember the answers
  but hard to remember the questions, or rather, the point of the answers.
  More notes [here]().

__Internet Shenanigans__:
* Nicky Case strikes again with an interactive article on
[attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/).
* [Beautifully gruesome autopsy
stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z2s2c/what_is_the_most_shitty_thing_about_becoming_an/)
* [This poignant reddit quote about becoming an adult](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z2s2c/what_is_the_most_shitty_thing_about_becoming_an/cfq20t6/)
* Sourcegraph is very open about their

* I came across this [nice tweetstorm from Heather Heying](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1269835093222158337?s=20), who, up until this point, I didn't know was Bret Weinstein's
wife, today and got sucked into a wonderful wormhole of political correctness
and ideological echo chambers and white atonement and not actually free free
speech riots and all the other liberal nonsense I haven't been able to put
coherent words to. And now I can say, with an absolutely farcical expression,
that everything that is wrong with the modern world is postmodernism.
  * Article 1: [Atonement is Activism](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/24/atonement-as-activism/)
    * White people like being flogged for harboring implicit biases and being
    racist to their bones by black people like Ta-Nehisi Coates. Note that
    Ta-Nehisi Coates is apparently uncomfortable with his son playing
    comfortably with white kids.
    * The parallels of this sometimes self-flagellation and [feet
   washing](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1269836041512349696?s=20) and
    looking for salvation / redemption from black people sounds a lot like....
    hmmm...Christanity?
  * Article 2: [Science is Being Made a Farce of by Grievance Studies](https://medium.com/@heyingh/grievance-studies-goes-after-the-scientific-method-63b6cfd9c913)
  * Article 3: [That Beautiful Memo from James
  Damore](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf)
  * Article 4: [Year Long Grievance Studies Experiment to Expose the Rotted
  Interior of this "Scientific" Edifice](https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/)
  * [U Chicago Report on Freedom of
  Expression](https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FOECommitteeReport.pdf)
    * [U Chicago Letter to Class of 2020 Freshman on the University's Commitment
  to Freedom of Expression](https://twitter.com/ChicagoMaroon/status/768561465183862785),
    including its lack of support for trigger warnings or safe spaces.
  * Note that democracy doesn't necessarily result in truth, because a majority
  of uneducated fools may not necessarily come to the right conclusions. [This
  article](https://moontowermeta.com/dinosaur-markets/) argues that markets have
  a stronger truth seeking mechanism called profit.
  * Is all truth falsifiable?

__Cool things I discovered__:
* [It's gorgeous](https://sonderdesign.com), but do I really need a $200
keyboard?
  * I could also get [this keyboard](https://waytools.com)...
* Literally buy shares in ['culture'](https://withotis.com/drop/tomb-of-dracula-10)
* [Superhuman bookmarking](https://getkozmos.com)

__Random Small Thoughts I'd Rather not tweet or Write a One-sentence Post for__:
* At a surface level, Thiel's assessment that China investing in the US (and
contributing to the trade deficit) is backwards is correct. Why would Chinese
people not invest in their own, faster growing securities? The second layer
thinking could be that China can get investment or loans at cheaper rates if
they park their money elsewhere.
* [My take on the remote work salary CoL adjustment whatever
nonsense](../08/remote-working-salary.html).

__Background Musics__:
* [Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkvaiG1rJA)
* [Studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgphHyGgeQU)

__Products I Love~__:
* [Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid
Containers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubbermaid+easy+find&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)!!!
So durable. They're perfect for those days when I open a 2lb+ package of
prepared carnitas or pulled pork from Costco~.

__Products I'm Debating Buying__:
* Airpods Pro? I don't often listen to music or digital sound outside of
podcasts I stream while driving, but I am itching to just throw a couple hundred
dollars at this white box and see what happens.

__Manga__:
* I've decided to put finishing [Diamond is
Unbreakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Is_Unbreakable) on hold. I'm
in a rut of boredom wrt the manga. It's been a fun, much more lighthearted ride
than Steel Ball Run. I don't regret the time I've already put into it, but, just
like Person of Interest, I don't see much value in personally uncovering the
details of what befalls the characters.
