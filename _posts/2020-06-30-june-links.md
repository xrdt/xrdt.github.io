Welcome to June, my friends. We are halfway through the year.

__Books (Bolded ones are recommended)__:
* __[Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)__
  * After months, no, maybe years of knowing about this book, I finally
  understand why some people read this little primer every year. The book is
  so simple, so intuitive, yet has so many little gems of quotes and pieces of
  perspective scattered throughout that it's worth devouring it all in one
  sitting once each year. [Here](../03/thinking-in-systems-quotes.html) are some
  quotes to pique your interest.
* [Confessions of the Pricing
Man](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Pricing-Man-Affects-Everything/dp/3319203991)
  * I got this book a few months ago, for free, from [The Waiter's
  Pad](https://thewaiterspad.com). I delayed reading it for so long because,
  well, you know, I'm BUSY! This is literally a book of cute anecdotes on price.
  I get pissed off while reading this because I don't feel like my brain is
  really going through some deep technical wringer that will dramatically
  enhance my life earnings / other material success, so I'm going to leave it
  half read and see if it improves enough with age to be worth picking up in the
  future.
* __[Kitchen
Confidential](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=kitchen+confidential&qid=1591558074&s=books&sr=1-2)__
  * I decided to finally (virtually) pick up this tome after reading another
  [whip-cracking honestly this is what the cruncher of big leagues professional
  cooking is like
  article](https://ruhlman.com/2010/09/20/so-you-wanna-be-a-chef-by-bourdain-2/?ck_subscriber_id=547821799)
  by Bourdain. It's good...as a sit by the pool with a just gripping enough but
  not too blood pressure raising book while on vacation read. He has a section
  on cooking tools and name drops a couple of famous cooking books, so if you
  actually want to get serious about upgrading your egg-frying equipment, you
  won't be entirely left to your own devices. I'm not yet convinced it's time
  for me to seriously up my cooking game, but my itch to sit down at the
  negotiating table and draw out the contract of "what kind of adult I want to
  be -- cooking edition" is only drawing nearer with every passing day. I love
  eating but I my hatred for paying restaurants to cook mediocre or just
  overpriced plates of mush or serve dry pastries to me is only growing, so
  perhaps this will be the summer I finally crack and fill my kitchens with
  beautiful little glass bowls for mise en place and shallots and King Arthur
  Flour and stainless steel "so heavy I will dent your face" sauce pans and
  Kerrygold butter and a "so sharp you'll cut yourself looking at it chef's
  knife" etc etc etc and fill the kitchen air with more than just the reek of
  slightly over-fried bacon and microwaved prepared meats from Costco.
* Still working on Dark Forest...Sorry, I'm a slow reader.
* __[How Children
Fail](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021)__,
by John Holt
  * I've been wanting to read this book since junior year of high school
  (approx. 7 years now). That was when I somehow got caught up into the
  conspiracy theory of Obama being a African Muslim and Charlotte Iserbyt's
  [Dumbing Down of
  America](https://www.amazon.com/deliberate-dumbing-down-america-Chronological/dp/0966707109/ref=sr_1_1)
  and [John
  Gatto](https://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Schooling/dp/0865718547/ref=sr_1_1).
  For whatever reason, even though I chatted frequently with a college friend
  who is no longer with us about education and how I would want to educate my
  kids and why traditional education has irrevocably screwed with our brains and
  is largely insufficient, despite the fact that the proportion of intellectual
  elites has probably never changed, I never read this book. Now I have. My
  fervor for the points Holt makes about how schools destroy children's minds
  through constant application of fear and how the proper way to teach is to let
  children follow their own paths. The only way that knowledge will stick is if
  a person asks their own questions, rather than writing down on paper or
  parroting back answers to questions others have fed them. When you feed
  someone questions and answers, it's easy to for them to remember the answers
  but hard to remember the questions, or rather, the point of the answers.
  More notes [here](../10/how-children-fail-notes.html).
* __[The PE Diet](http://www.thepediet.com)__
  * I listened to a HVMN podcast with Ted Naiman, thought what he was saying
  made sense, and finally decided to read his book. The book is written in a
  brain-dead simple way. Some people hate it for oversimplifying, even relative
  to [Ted's other lectures], but you have to give the man some kudos for
  distilling this insanely complex web of nutritional and dieting advice into
  a couple of simple rules that make enough sense and clearly have amazing
  results. Give it a shot.
* __[The Way It Spozed To
Be](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Spozed-Be-Innovators-Education/dp/0867094079)__
  * First, WTF, did anybody notice the [hardcover
  prices](../../../images/expensive_book.png) on this book at $930+??
  * I picked up this small little memoir because John Holt mentions it in
  <u>How Children Fail</u>. When I say "mentions", Holt literally mentions the
  book once, in passing. Anyways, I pick it up because I'm in this mode of
  wanting to hear what these masters of unbreaking the 1960s American education
  system have to say about educating these young, incipient members of society
  to be as productive, happy, and curious as their forefathers were. I was
  thrown in for a huge shock. First, Herdon's school is a black school, embedded
  in some Californian ghetto. These are not the white, middle-class kids that
  John Holt was working with. Herndon's kids are straight up "ghetto", with all
  the inflection and stereotypical implications you can put on that word.
  Herndon manages to make some progress in getting to know the kids, but he's
  eventually fired for not being able to demonstrate his ability to "control"
  the class. The book is page after page of utterly demoralizing and frustrating
  and almost aimless recounts of his time at this one black school in
  California. Unlike Holt, he doesn't sprinkle bits of real motivation or
  breakthroughs in thinking throughout his memoirs. And by the end, he's utterly
  [demoralized](../18/spozed-to-be.html). I know I'm not saying much in this
  paragraph, but if you read the link attached to "demoralized", maybe you'll
  get a sense that I've also fallen into the mental funk and hopelessness that
  Herndon also fell into, years after his experience with that black, ghetto
  school in California.
* [Eleven Rings: The Soul of
Success](https://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-Success-Phil-Jackson/dp/0143125346)
  * You might enjoy this more if you know things about basketball. I got bored,
  not only because I didn't know who was who or why they mattered, but also
  because there's really no depth to the book. My brain was on autopilot. It's
  a fine book if you're looking to pass the time by the pool or in the plane
  during vacation, but I really don't see how this book will allow you to
  improve your [analytical or informational or dispositional
  advantages](../20/action-advantage.html)
* __[How to Survive in Your Native
Land](https://www.amazon.com/Survive-Your-Native-Innovators-Education/dp/0867094087)__
  * James Herdon's second book. It's a travelogue that follows upon the heels
  of <u>The Way it Spozed To Be</u>. This book isn't quite so bleak, because I
  think James has learned to accept the human condition and the fact that no
  one knows what the heck to be doing in school. He and some other teachers try
  experimenting with "free classes", where the kids get a couple of periods to
  just pursue their own fancies. This is a complete disaster because the kids
  expect the teachers to tell them what to do but the teachers expect the kids
  to tell them what to do. They end up getting into an exceedingly frustrating
  situation where some kids complain all day about there being nothing to do but
  reject all suggestions for things to do. Of course, that's not the end of the
  story. They eventually evolve this free classroom into one with a couple
  periods of mandatory reading, semi-mandatory math, and then free time. The
  objective of the reading period was to give the kids time to actually sit down
  and read, [not work on practice
  worksheets](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/)
  with phonics or other practice *for* reading. As usual, I've put some choice
  quotes [here](../27/survive-native-land.html).
  * I enjoyed this book more than the previous one, though I do recommend the
  previous one just for some context and acclimation to his writing style. The
  previous travelogue is also cleaner.
  * What's next? Herndon's written a few more books on education that seem just
  as wandering and muse-like as the two I've already read. I want to get
  something more concrete under my belt before I come back to him, so I might
  jump to John Holt's <u>How Children Learn</u> or try something from
  [Kohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_R._Kohl) or
  [Gattegno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Gattegno). What's for sure is
  that these books can keep me occupied for quite some time.

wife, today and got sucked into a wonderful wormhole of political correctness
and ideological echo chambers and white atonement and not actually free free
speech riots and all the other liberal nonsense I haven't been able to put
coherent words to. And now I can say, with an absolutely farcical expression,
that everything that is wrong with the modern world is postmodernism.
  * Article 1: [Atonement is Activism](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/24/atonement-as-activism/)
    * White people like being flogged for harboring implicit biases and being
    racist to their bones by black people like Ta-Nehisi Coates. Note that
    Ta-Nehisi Coates is apparently uncomfortable with his son playing
    comfortably with white kids.
    * The parallels of this sometimes self-flagellation and [feet
   washing](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1269836041512349696?s=20) and
    looking for salvation / redemption from black people sounds a lot like....
    hmmm...Christanity? The only difference is that there is no hope for those
    who practice this PC self flagellation. No matter how much they bend
    themselves over backwards and say, falsely, I had no idea how bad slavery
    was, they will never be reconciled with the fundamentally and perpetually
    aggrieved blacks. The issue is that we've now hit the point where you either
    fall upon your sword every time something with even the marginal potential
    to offen appears or could appear (safe spaces to avoid talking about hard
    things, classes on PC topics to perpetuate the need for struggle sessions
    about white on black racism and oppression, trigger warnings so sensitive
    ears can stay deaf to exactly the issues they think are so important to
    express an unending movement of frustration over) or you get mauled for
    being insensitive and unwoke and simply someone who's not welcome (now you
    know what it's like to be discriminated against, haha). Do you think people
    chose to bring this upon themselves?

  really have trouble keeping up with the conversation, but I think it's a
  stupid habit of mine. It's especially egregious if what I have to say before
  the name is long. Why do I do this? I suspect it's a carry over from when I
  was a child and my parents tried to get me to address them when I wanted their
  attention. I resented the disciplinary action and this phenomenon is a
  carryover from bygone times. *sigh*, one day I'll grow up.

people not invest in their own, faster growing securities? The second layer
thinking could be that China can get investment or loans at cheaper rates if
they park their money elsewhere.

nonsense](../08/remote-working-salary.html).
* No matter how intellectually amazing any single person is, you know you can
eventually come to expect a certain style, a certain way of framing or seeing
the world from them. That is why I need to follow so many distinct entities on
Twitter or read so many distinct books. But I know that no matter how many
disparate sources of information I absorb in an attempt to become
multidimensional and *truly interesting*, I will also end up becoming a person
who has one single, distinct way of exposing portions of the universal knowledge
graph. Isn't that amazing? I try to fancy myself the small end point of a funnel
with a wide mouth. But I know that even if I succeed in being an interesting
person that other people are willing to listen to, I can only be a speck in the
wide end of their individual funnels.
* Ok, so I guess I did [tweet this
one](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1277722666967822336.html). This is about
audio vs visual AR.
* Ok, [another one I did end up tweeting](https://t.co/o8KUnFqUqh?amp=1). This
is about treating and viewing children like less than human.

__Products I Love~__:
* [Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid
Containers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubbermaid+easy+find&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)!!!
So durable. They're perfect for those days when I open a 2lb+ package of
prepared carnitas or pulled pork from Costco~.

Man, I really was starting to hate the tactile feel of the latest Magic
Keyboard. This keyboard really blows that device out of the water in terms of
chiclet feel. Sure, it's not mechanical, but I haven't yet found that mechanical
switches really deliver that much added typing value for me.

__Products I'm Debating Buying__:
* Airpods Pro? I don't often listen to music or digital sound outside of
podcasts I stream while driving, but I am itching to just throw a couple hundred
dollars at this white box and see what happens.
  * I'd be down to try another pair of wireless buds that works well with Apple
  devices.

__Manga__:
* I've decided to put finishing [Diamond is
Unbreakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Is_Unbreakable) on hold. I'm
in a rut of boredom wrt the manga. It's been a fun, much more lighthearted ride
than Steel Ball Run. I don't regret the time I've already put into it, but, just
like Person of Interest, I don't see much value in personally uncovering the
details of what befalls the characters.

__Entertainment__:
* Watched a few episodes of [Kim's
Convenience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim%27s_Convenience) the other day.
It's an ok show. It's not super funny, it's very clearly blocked and structured
to set up and accentuate the nonsense quirks of the characters, the parents'
accents are played up, it's super clean, but it's not fantastic. It's pretty
much only useful to help you shut your brain off.
