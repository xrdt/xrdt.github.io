Welcome to June, my friends. We are halfway through the year.

Books:
* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)
  * After months, no, maybe years of knowing about this book, I finally
  understand why some people read this little primer every year. The book is
  so simple, so intuitive, yet has so many little gems of quotes and pieces of
  perspective scattered throughout that it's worth devouring it all in one
  sitting once each year. [Here](../03/thinking-in-systems-quotes.html) are some
  quotes to pique your interest.
* [Confessions of the Pricing
Man](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Pricing-Man-Affects-Everything/dp/3319203991)
  * I got this book a few months ago, for free, from The Waiter's Pad. I delayed
  reading it for so long because, well, you know, I'm BUSY! This is literally a
  book of cute anecdotes on price. I get pissed of while reading this because I
  don't feel like my brain is really going through some deep technical wringer
  that will dramatically enhance my life earnings / other material success, so
  I'm going to leave it half read and see if it improves enough with age to be
  worth picking up in the future.
* [Kitchen
Confidential](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=kitchen+confidential&qid=1591558074&s=books&sr=1-2)
  * I decided to finally (virtually) pick up this tome after reading another
  [whip-cracking honestly this is what the cruncher of big leagues professional
  cooking is like
  article](https://ruhlman.com/2010/09/20/so-you-wanna-be-a-chef-by-bourdain-2/?ck_subscriber_id=547821799)
  by Bourdain. It's good...as a sit by the pool with a just gripping enough but
  not too blood pressure raising book while on vacation read. He has a section
  on cooking tools and name drops a couple of famous cooking books, so if you
  actually want to get serious about upgrading your egg-frying equipment, you
  won't be entirely left to your own devices. I'm not yet convinced it's time
  for me to seriously up my cooking game, but my itch to sit down at the
  negotiating table and draw out the contract of "what kind of adult I want to
  be -- cooking edition" is only drawing nearer with every passing day. I love
  eating but I my hatred for paying restaurants to cook mediocre or just
  overpriced plates of mush or serve dry pastries to me is only growing, so
  perhaps this will be the summer I finally crack and fill my kitchens with
  beautiful little glass bowls for mise en place and shallots and King Arthur
  Flour and stainless steel "so heavy I will dent your face" sauce pans and
  Kerrygold butter and a "so sharp you'll cut yourself looking at it chef's
  knife" etc etc etc and fill the kitchen air with more than just the reek of
  slightly over-fried bacon and microwaved prepared meats from Costco.

Internet Shenanigans:
* Nicky Case strikes again with an interactive article on
[attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/).
* [Beautifully gruesome autopsy
stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z2s2c/what_is_the_most_shitty_thing_about_becoming_an/)
* [This poignant reddit quote about becoming an adult](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z2s2c/what_is_the_most_shitty_thing_about_becoming_an/cfq20t6/)
* Sourcegraph is very open about their

[OKRs](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/okrs),

* I came across this [nice tweetstorm from Heather Heying](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1269835093222158337?s=20), who, up until this point, I didn't know was Bret Weinstein's
wife, today and got sucked into a wonderful wormhole of political correctness
and ideological echo chambers and white atonement and not actually free free
speech riots and all the other liberal nonsense I haven't been able to put
coherent words to. And now I can say, with an absolutely farcical expression,
that everything that is wrong with the modern world is postmodernism.
  * Article 1: [Atonement is Activism](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/24/atonement-as-activism/)
    * White people like being flogged for harboring implicit biases and being
    racist to their bones by black people like Ta-Nehisi Coates.
  * Article 2: [Science is getting f\*\*\*ed in the a\*\* by Grievance
  Studies](https://medium.com/@heyingh/grievance-studies-goes-after-the-scientific-method-63b6cfd9c913)
  * Article 3: [That Beautiful Memo from James
  Damore](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf)
  * Article 4: [Man These People Made a Farce out of Grievance
  Studies](https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/)

Cool things I discovered:
* [It's gorgeous](https://sonderdesign.com), but do I really need a $200
keyboard?
  * I could also get [this keyboard](https://waytools.com)...
* Literally buy shares in ['culture'](https://withotis.com/drop/tomb-of-dracula-10)
* [Superhuman bookmarking](https://getkozmos.com)

Random Small Thoughts I'd Rather not tweet or Write a One-sentence Post for:
* At a surface level, Thiel's assessment that China investing in the US (and
contributing to the trade deficit) is backwards is correct. Why would Chinese
people not invest in their own, faster growing securities? The second layer
thinking could be that China can get investment or loans at cheaper rates if
they park their money elsewhere.
* [My take on the remote work salary CoL adjustment whatever nonsense](../.

Background Musics:
* [Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkvaiG1rJA)
* [Studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgphHyGgeQU)

Products I Love~:
* [Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid
Containers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubbermaid+easy+find&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)!!!
So durable. They're perfect for those days when I open a 2lb+ package of
prepared carnitas or pulled pork from Costco~.

Products I'm Debating Buying:
* Airpods Pro? I don't often listen to music or digital sound outside of
podcasts I stream while driving, but I am itching to just throw a couple hundred
dollars at this white box and see what happens.

Manga:
* I've decided to put finishing [Diamond is
Unbreakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Is_Unbreakable) on hold. I'm
in a rut of boredom wrt the manga. It's been a fun, much more lighthearted ride
than Steel Ball Run. I don't regret the time I've already put into it, but, just
like Person of Interest, I don't see much value in personally uncovering the
details of what befalls the characters.
