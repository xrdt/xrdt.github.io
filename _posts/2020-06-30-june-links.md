Welcome to June, my friends. We are halfway through the year.

Books:
* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)
  * After months, no, maybe years of knowing about this book, I finally
  understand why some people read this little primer every year. The book is
  so simple, so intuitive, yet has so many little gems of quotes and pieces of
  perspective scattered throughout that it's worth devouring it all in one
  sitting once each year. [Here](../03/thinking-in-systems-quotes.html) are some
  quotes to pique your interest.

Internet Shenanigans:
* Nicky Case strikes again with an interactive article on
[attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/).

Cool products I discovered:
* [It's gorgeous](https://sonderdesign.com), but do I really need a $200
keyboard?
  * Gah, I could also get [this keyboard](https://waytools.com)...

Products I Love~:
* [Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid
Containers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubbermaid+easy+find&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)!!!
So durable. They're perfect for those days when I open a 2lb+ package of
prepared carnitas or pulled pork from Costco~.

Manga:
* Whoo, I finished [Diamond is
Unbreakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Is_Unbreakable). Now I'm only
6 more parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure behind!!
  * What's most impressive about this series is how many side stories and
  characters can be introduced without disrupting the main flow of the plot.
  Everybody contributes in their own little way to the madness of what befalls
  this formerly sleepy little tourist town of Morioh.
  * This part is so much more lighthearted than Steel Ball Run. Since the
  main characters are a bunch of high school kids,
