Welcome to June, my friends. We are halfway through the year.

Books:
* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)
  * After months, no, maybe years of knowing about this book, I finally
  understand why some people read this little primer every year. The book is
  so simple, so intuitive, yet has so many little gems of quotes and pieces of
  perspective scattered throughout that it's worth sitting for a day and
  devouring it once a year.


Internet Shenanigans:
* Nicky Case strikes again with a nice interactive article on
[attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/).

Cool products I discovered:
* [It's gorgeous](https://sonderdesign.com), but do I really need a $200
keyboard?
  * Gah, I could also get [this keyboard](https://waytools.com)...

Products I Love~:
* Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid Containers!!! So durable and easy to use.
