__Newsletter Wisdom__:
* What intuition? From [Alexey
  Guzey](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/misperceiving-inequality)
  > If the experts cannot assess inequality accurately, it strains credulity to
  > suppose the man in the street can gauge it intuitively. And the difficulty of
  > measuring the actual income distribution does not affect our second point:
  > that perceptions of inequality—whether or not they are accurate—do correlate
  > with political preferences.
* [WHO's the WHO?](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1250416307083730944)
* [Moments of weakness in the 2000 tech bubble](https://twitter.com/jsmian/status/1249429893408002054)
* There are lots of time when I feel like the set of newsletters I'm following
  isn't nearly information dense enough. [Here's a list of interesting
  blogs](https://www.benkuhn.net/blogroll/) that can help get me out of that
  funk.
* [Be decisive](https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008)
* [Games as a release from the
  friendliness](https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/family-feuds-agnes-callard/)
  needed for care.
* [Fakepixels
  48](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-vol48-all-good-work-is-done)
  > all good work is done in defiance of management -- Bob Woodward.

__Languages as Mediums of Expression__:
* [Alexey Guzey on a Russian
  podcast](https://soundcloud.com/podlodka/podlodka-159-zdorovyy-son)
  * For later...his voice reminds me of Mohit Saini's voice.

__Amusing Ourselves to Death__:
* [Politics of
  Information](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/politics-of-information-henry-farrell/)
  > One of the crucial questions we need to understand is how this world of
  > information surfeit, of information overload, is stressing and straining our
  > political system.
  <br>---<br>
  > China in particular, you have these feedback loops between the categories
  > that people are using to try and understand the world in the central
  > committees, and the actual world they are trying to explain [...] the
  > categories you use are likely to reflect the ideas of your superiors, even
  > if you know that they’re wrong.[...]
  > That can have terrible consequences if machine learning reflects the
  > categories of official thought, and then interprets the policy consequences
  > in terms of these categories too, so that bias compounds bias.

__Building Something You Can Pass on to Future Generations__:
* [Forceful rebuilding](https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1084677824370233344)
  * Rewriting software at Google.
  * Every 20 years Ise Grand Shrine rebuilding.

__Lessons Learned from Other People Who Also Write Software__:
* [John Ousterhout Sayings](https://web.archive.org/web/20180818000020/http:/web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/sayings.php)
  * The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from
    not-working to working.
  * Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them.
  * The most important component of evolution is death.
    * Software's relatively malleability is an impediment to the refresh in
      thinking and structure that is the cleansing ritual of death.
  * Facts precede concepts.
  * If you don't know what the problem was, you haven't fixed it.
  * If it hasn't been used, it doesn't work.
    * Reality is always more complicated than you think it is. No one can
      encompass the entire extent of the details of the paces one's users will
      put one's software through.
  * The only thing worse than a problem that happens all the time is a problem
    that doesn't happen all the time.
  * The three most powerful words for building credibility are "I don't know".
  * Coherent systems are inherently unstable.
    * Coherency ~= uniformity.
    * Remember when [Makishima was going to hijack the food supply of
   Japan](https://psychopass.fandom.com/wiki/Uka-no-Mitama_Defense_Virus)?
* [Lack of Holes in Interfaces as Measure of Code
  Honesty](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/functional-code-is-honest-code)

__The Intellecutal Stubbornss of People__:
* [People who take visits to the Bay
  Area](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24684368) to learn the secrets of
  the startup ecosystem leave appalled at things that make the ecosystem work,
  like illegal non-competes.

__People Thinking Things Through__:
* [Building a better font
  proof](https://www.typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts)
* [A melodic
  piece](https://lithub.com/the-new-silences-of-rome-under-quarantine/)
  recording a woman's experience of the beginning of quarantine in Rome.
  > There were just a handful of people [at the Coliseum], and we felt
  > surrounded by an atmosphere of peaceful suspension, as when it snows and
  > everything is wrapped in cotton wool. The ruins were magnificent, standing
  > alone in the empty landscape, as though they were revealed to us for the
  > first time. Rome never looked so beautiful with all its cracks, ruins, and
  > old age. I felt grateful for its resilience to time and wars and
  > catastrophes.
* A blog writer who I didn't know about until I saw his farewell piece linked
  to in a newsletter [muses on his time nurturing this public wall to throw
  mental spaghetti
  at](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2020/05/farewell-beyond-beyond/).
  > What people cheerfully paid for, and what they actually cared about, were
  > different things.
  * I feel like it's really not a shame to have put the public facing
    version of this blog to sleep. Blogging it not a youthful activity. It's
    not particulary helping me explore new frontiers. At this point, I've given
    up on writing original content and resign myself to copy pasting links to
    other people's attempts to explore the world that is constantly shifting
    around us. I still write, just to keep myself half intellectually alive,
    but I'm also looking for the next place in which to expand my
    consciousness. Maybe I really will disappear from the public and the
    material world. I'm a mysterious fuck because I can't be bothered to trust
    people. I won't deny that my lack of ability to trust and open up to people
    has probably cost me the opportunity to have really nice friendships. Then
    again, I find most friendships that I partially observed in college to be
    full of dull nonsense.
* ["Take the risks you can't at
  scale"](https://twitter.com/backus/status/1104586601340887040)
* [Scholar's Stage post on
  Rioting](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/05/on-days-of-disorder.html)
  * [Danco](https://danco.substack.com/p/lets-just-get-rid-of-peer-review)
    brings up a similar point about how to align the entire scientific
    community around getting rid of publisher's strangehold on information
    transfer. Turns out COVID was a great "incident" around which to spur all
    the dissatisfied participants (ahem, anybody that's not a rent-collecting
    publisher named Elsevier) into coordinated action (on Twitter, Tweep
    Tweep).
* [Drew Austin explains some thoughts on how Las Vegas is the microcosm of the
  US](https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/127-night-society).
  > Las Vegas exhibits more extreme and openly acknowledged versions of the
  > conditions that also characterize more ordinary places; we didn’t quite
  > realize how much of life happened indoors until everything closed, and I
  > imagine that right now in Vegas there isn’t much to do at all.
  * Can we escape Koolhaus's
  [Junkspace](https://www.johnstuartarchitecture.com/Spring_2009_Video_Readings_files/Koolhaas%20Junkspace.pdf)?
  * Tourist style consumption has permeated every part of the physical world.
* [Are American leaders thinking about conflict with China in the wrong
  way](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/6/2/dont-bring-a-knife-to-a-gunfight-with-china)?
* I don't know what you call the kind of journalist the author is, but at least
  for Doyle, the object is to ["justify the ways of God to
  men"](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/scandal/hidden-agendas). Ah, who am
  I kidding, everybody's attempts to understand the world are merely their
  efforts at justifying the ways of God to themselves.
* [Dan Luu explaining why companies employ so many
  people](https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/)
  * [Ref from patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1255371954443505665)
  * [Reminds me of this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24443807)
  > Just as with performance, people underestimate how many engineers you can
  > add to a product before engineers stop paying for themselves.
  * Boy, are the technical problems easy relative to the organizational
    problems.
  > When I talk to higher-ups and compare what they think they're saying to
  > what my coworkers think they're saying, I find that the rate of lost
  > messages is well over 50%, every message gets corrupted, and latency can be
  > months or years.
  * The reality of working on software is that really, the software team is not
    the most important team in the org. The team that brings in the money is
    the most important team:
    > For a lot of products, the sales team is more important than the
    > engineering team.
  * There's something you just will never know when you're on the outside. Good
    Lord, how much of police / investigative work would be impossible without
    confidential informants or "inside knowledge"? Probably 90% of it (my
    stupid and probably wildly wrong outsider's perspective):
    > Whenever I read outsider's descriptions of what's wasteful at the
    > companies I've worked at, they're almost inevitably wrong.
* [Stanley
  Druckenmiller](https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Druckenmiller-_Speech.pdf)
  reminiscing on his investment career in 2015
  * Biggest mistake was playing around in March 2000 even though he knew he
    shouldn't do it. "I was just an emotional basket case and I couldn't help
    myself."
* [Emergence of Chinese hi-fi audio device
  products](https://twitter.com/danwwang/status/1231738051115634688) as an
  example of [process knowledge](https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/), or
  tacit knowledge that comes from the experience of building something.
* [You cannot hesitate to make choices that you know are
  right](https://zackkanter.com/2012/11/06/creating-a-vacuum-or-when-to-move-on/).
* A nice plug for Dan Wang's thoughts on the emerging hi-fi manufacturers in
  China that have "process knowledge"

* [Bob Horning Building
  on](https://tinyletter.com/robhorning/letters/lead-and-felt) [Drew Austin's
  piece about digital space](https://reallifemag.com/home-screens/) and what
  the pandemic has made us realize about Big Tech's promises for letting us
  exist fluidly and letting us create interfaces between ourselves and
  everything else on the Internet at will.
  > Being “online” was never actually an alternative to “real life,”
  <br>---<br>
  > The self is externalized and becomes a brand rather than the inviolate
  > vehicle through which one experiences being alive. [...] One’s life, ones
  > self, is no longer conceived a mere work of art but as a collection — the
  > trajectory of the self articulated through the images one makes and
  > assembles to represent it.
  <br>---<br>
  > Museums have become staging grounds for visitors' self-representations; the
  > collected artworks function as props. The “works” that visitors make become
  > more significant than the ones they see there.
  * Late capitalism --> noninvested surplus capital.
  * Museums no longer are defined by their appreciating asset portfolios.
  > Minimalist art has become Instagram cliché.
* Drew Austin quoting Hans Ibelings
  > public space has changed from a meeting place, the heart of social life,
  > into a highly regulated domain where every individual imagines him or
  > herself secure and also takes it for granted that this security is
  > guaranteed.

  <br>...<br>
  > Each of us is a unique, irreplaceable soul enclosed in a fragile shell. ...
  > And each of us, to a greater or lesser degree, is confronting a high,
  > solid wall. The wall has a name: It is The System. The System is supposed

  > order to prevent it from tangling our souls in its web and demeaning them.
  > I fully believe it is the novelist's job to keep trying to clarify the
  > uniqueness of each individual soul by writing stories - stories of life and
  > death, stories of love, stories that make people cry and quake with fear
  > and shake with laughter. This is why we go on, day after day, concocting
  > fictions with utter seriousness.
  <br>...<br>
  > The System did not make us: We made The System.

__Other People's Pithy Musings (Taken out of Context)__:

— Max Beerbohm
* Bob Lefsetz on Adele on SNL (basically, it was a joke that she appeared
  there)
  > But the truth is image and career management are what separates the legends
  > from the rest of the acts.

__Having a "Life"__:
* I needed some guidance on the kick serve. [Here it
  is](https://www.tennisplayer.net/public/classiclessons/chris_lewit/keys_to_the_kick/keys_to_the_kick_page2.html).
* I have gotten agitated with that ever so familiar feeling of "I don't know
  how to answer this question in a truthful way without diffusing an off
  putting part of my personality" ever since people started asking "what have
  you been doing since quarantine started?". I have done nothing new. I have,
  like most other people, cut back on activities and overall become a more
  boring person. I've become more dependent on the Internet. I've weaved in and
  out of the standard depths of emotional discomfort that have accompanied me
  since I left college and was expected to stand on my own two feet in the
  "adult world". I've switched jobs (only true once October started). I'm
  trying to improve my strength. I'm still the same ungrateful, unhappy, not as
  smart as she wants to be fool who's trying to figure out where she wants to
  go in life. Is that good enough of a disjointed paragraph answer?

__Home Improvements__:

__Life Organization__:
* Now that I've discovered [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) (10/28), I'm
  going to stop using this blog for recording my readings. This blog will go
  back to its proper purpose as a repository for longer-form explorations of
  my understanding of the world and hopefully of world's that I create.
