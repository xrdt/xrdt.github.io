I have an obsession with nostalgia, mono no aware, saudade, meraki, all those things that stir a little
twinge in our hearts and remind us of those fragile, beautiful emotions that make us human. Catch me at the
right moment with a nice [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Yesterday_(1991_film)) or expertly
laid out [slice of life manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik≈ç) and you might just induce
those tears ducts of mine to ramp up production.

I've been this way for as long as I can remember having a distinct fear of death. I was probably 6 or 7 years
old when I had a dream about everybody else on earth either dying or just disappearing, leaving me to fend
for myself in a [barren desert](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://allthefujoshiunite.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/doomsday4.jpg&imgrefurl=https://allthefujoshiunite.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/monster-without-a-name/&tbnid=2OE-wXxsDbyW8M&vet=1&docid=oiO7vP0zihJvvM&w=1550&h=1100&q=monster+manga+johan+liebert+final+scene&source=sh/x/im).
That really drove the fear of death into me, and I spent enough of that night in my parents' bed trying to resolve
my overwhelming fear of losing things that mattered to me and of losing myself to that final void.

Fast forward a decade plus from my first awakening to mortality and I've had many, many more nights and moments of feeling terrified
of the reality that one day all those things, memories, experiences, people, etc. that I've emotionally attached to
will one day disappear forever. Some of things will likely disappear with me. But the pain is fine, I reason, because
it's what makes us human. It's in these moments of pain that we remember what matters to us, that we remember those
people from years and miles ago who shaped us into who we are today, that we feel an urge to cherish the tiny little
grasp on reality we've been given.

I'm finding myself growing more and more tender in this area as I grow older, which feels embarrassing (because I don't
think other people are quite to sensitive about this) but I suppose it's just a mental place where I haven't found
closure. I hope that when it comes time for me to leave the world, that I am ready, and that those who are there to
see me off will be filled with mono no aware, appreciative of what we've shared and deeply moved by the realization
of my mortality. I hope that I will demonstrate a similar grace when I face the partings of others destined to leave before me.
