Update (8/15/2018). [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=learn):
Increasing efficiency doesn't necessarily reduce consumption.

Can you think of any naturally occurring resource that is single use? The only
ones that came to my mind were oil and natural gas. They take so long to
regenerate that they are effectively one use.

Every thing else in the world, from animals to water to trees to carbon, has
been designed to be consumed and reproduced in a *cycle*. We humans have
disrupted that cycle. We have caused the extinction of many species,
destroyed natural landscapes to fuel our growth and technical interests,
erased languages and cultures from the current consciousness, and completely
mismanaged the earth we were given to steward.

There are gallant efforts in chemistry and materials science to shift our
resource dependencies away from non-renewable sources like petroleum onto
more renewable resources like plants. Many restaurants now eschew plastic in
favor of plant-based, compostable plastic-like utensils and to go boxes.
Plastic shopping bags have been banned in LA, but the rise of reusable
shopping bags made of *plastic, most likely,* probably offsets the "gains" we
hoped for. We want to make our automobiles more fuel efficient, but their
sheer size and the public's desire for big, powerful, AWD SUVs is cramping
environmental chemists' styles. We think we can reverse the trend by planting
trees, but we don't think about the cost of acquiring a tree, raising the
tree, maintaining the tree, and preventing carbon release upon tree death or
harvest. The trees are a part of the natural resource renewal cycle. They
cannot *reverse* they trend; they can only maintain the current status. We
want to reduce water usage, but nobody in the US seriously cares enough about
water usage to track it, enforce water policies, and *really* help save the
earth.

This problem of consumption levels and the futility of these carbon neutral,
efficiency efforts is an idea that really struck me recently. Is the
fundamental human misbehavior that is causing climate change *not* our
__egregious consumption__?

Does anybody remember the 3R's of recycling?
[__Reduce__, Reuse, Recycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_hierarchy).
If you follow the link, you'll see that the first priority in the waste
hierarcy is PREVENTION. The second? MINIMIZATION. All my life, the only
piece of the 3R's that has been emphasized has been recycling. Granted, the
recycling logo is a loop, so there is no real beginning or end, but the
hierarchy makes it clear that again, "prevention is the best cure". We are
so far beyond prevention that we should have moved to the next rung,
MINIMIZATION. Instead, being the self-gratifying, hedonistic, low-willpower,
consumerist, materialistic pigs we are, we decided to go further down the
hierarchy and make everybody take the easy action of disposal or recycling.
You have lots of trash? Just buy a bigger trash can and recycling bin and
pay a slight larger nominal fee. We'll still take care of it for you. You
still go to Costco and buy way more food and cups and everything than you
need? No problem, the trash that you produce, food and otherwise, is all
hidden somewhere safe, so you'll never know just how bad your contribution is.

This statement will tie into a future post I'll make about interfaces,
especially human-computer ones, but I think we've thought completely wrong
about disciplining the populace (and companies, but let's talk about the
people for now) on environmental concerns. It's surprising to most people that
being strict about principles and rules makes other people have more respect
for them. The librarian who asks the rowdy after-school crowd to quiet down
and to not abuse library resources gains not only the respect of the other
library users but also the respect of the after-school crowd. They know she
is a person of her word and know not to try pushing the boundaries with her.
We respect people who have been through the Army because we know of their
loyalty and their persistence. Because they have been through such grueling
training, we know we can rely on them to give multiples more back to the
civilian communities.

This is exactly the line of reasoning we should be taking with environmental
issues. We have no respect for the government and related efforts because
every year it promises more and achieves less. Everything costs more and
does less. (Note that tech is the exact opposite. We would be appalled if last
year's gadgets cost more this year.) We have no respect for energy companies
or the countries which hold oil reserves because they have demonstrated their
political wiliness and self-interest. And, the public has no respect for
movements like no-trash or homesteading because they've been given so many
free passes on dealing with trash and waste. They've been encouraged to
consume, consume, consume, endlessly. If we were stronger about people
toeing the line with respect to consumption and waste production, people will
respect the movements more. People can deny these issues because of all the
free passes they have been given. They aren't really affected, is what they
think. Hippies are the only ones who are deluded enough to care and live
on a farm or trash-free. How can they raise their kids like that? I think
that, as I'm sure people have anecdotally discovered, that the more they
put into achieving low-waste, low consumption, sustainble lifestyles, the
more they get out of their lives. Analogously, the more you put into exercise,
the more you get out of it. Let's help people create these positive feedback
cycles and realize that growing their own food sustainbly can be fun. Living
no- or low-waste can be equivalent or better than living high-waste. Using
less water doesn't make you miserable. Riding your bike rather than commuting
by car makes you more happy (endorphins!). Being outside rather than using
electricity to light your indoor office keeps you awake better, fixes sleep
issues, and helps you bond with nature.

Humans are the only species to try to improve their lives. Beavers build dams
they way they always have. Birds sing the way they always have. Fish swim
the way they always have. Humans have taken their curiosity, ingenuity, and
ability, and created higher standards of living every decade. But the costs
of those higher standards is crippling the earth which has given us the
opportunity to continue improving.

So let's rethink everything we've been taught about how to live a good life.
Let's take care of our earth the way the natives did and are still trying to.
This planet is, as far as we are concerned (the universe probably thinks
otherwise), a non-renewable resource.

I know people are probably going to hate me for not citing any papers or
scientific, data-based results for the above claims, but I think some of my
claims are not too controversial or wrong. I will either find some articles
and put them in to beef up my argument or link to a completely new
argument so I can preserve the history of my blog.

Three degrees is all it takes for

I'm sure you can feel theh heat, especially if you don't have air
conditioning. What will you do about it?
