Wow, has it been a long time since I wrote anything meaningful on this blog.
It's not a particularly impressive achievement, but I'd say I'm happy with my
having posted a new thought every month for over 2 years now.
Suffice it to say, my reticence is a result of my suffering from what I'd
like to very gracefully term a recalibration of my ambitions and energies. I
tweeted this not too
long ago: ["Money is the first constraint. Time is the second constraint.
Curiosity is the final constraint"](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1220750799636033542).

As much as I'd like to believe that my desire to materially enrich myself is
pathological, I can't shake that obnoxious little voice that keeps yelling at
me to go [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) and buy expensive
equipment so I can pursue expensive hobbies. But I know that getting those
toys and learning how to use them properly isn't the end. Getting good enough
at what I want to do will take time, and even the richest person in the world
needs to know how to arrange things on a schedule so they don't lose their mind
or their health or their family and friends. Let's say I've figured out money
and I've gotten the scheduling down pat with the help of a classic tool:
delegation. The last barrier to satisfaction in life is keeping myself
interested enough in the world to continue going on. That was the
reason for my [thread about cryonics](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1225917010569097216)
and giving people the option to opt out or take a break from life when they
are ready. I've put on my [homepage](../../../index.html) that willpower +
curiosity = success. I think there's a reasonable amount of prescriptions for
willpower (meditation, gradually increasing time periods of delayed gratification,
getting good at stuff...) but curiosity seems much more innate, much more fragile,
and thus much harder to genuinely develop. Willpower can be applied to just about
anything. Curiosity? A bit hard to force that one...just look at the laundry list
of items I'm not interested in airing in public of things I've tried to be interested
in. Blame lack of curiosity on poor environment and lack of mentorship and dearth of
educational guidance and I still think I'll find fine art relatively a waste of time
compared to racing cars or writing software or paragliding. The fragility and fickleness
of curiosity is why

[coaches](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Winning-Creative-Battle/dp/1501260626) and
[writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) emphasize willpower or techniques
to increase or conserve willpower. They know that we want to get things done. They know it
makes us happy to check things off our bucket lists and to have things to show off to other
people and to just plain follow through and get closure. But the horrible flakiness of curiosity
is also the reason I think that if there is something that you really want to do, you should
throw yourself into it as purely and as wholeheartedly as possible. Exhaust your ability to love
that one or several things in your life, because you probably won't have many things that can
capture your attention and make you feel alive that aggressively.
