I hate Apple Podcasts. It is possibly the worst Apple software I have touched in my life
(trying to decipher the sparse AppleScript and Objective-C documentation is a close second, but
do you really count that as a software?). The app is constantly screwing up my queue. I'll pause
the podcast, come back in a few hours, and some other episode from some other show in my
library will be "currently playing". What happened to the one I was __just playing__? Gone,
booted, waiting for me to readd it.

What else...oh that's right. If I add an episode to my queue from a show I haven't subscribed
to, I can guarantee that that episode will __disappear__ from my queue within the next few
hours. WHY??? Subscribing to a show also automatically adds the latest episode to my library.
Not sure why that's useful, especially because I may not care about the latest episode, but
there you go.

What else...I can't tell it to play all the episodes in a podcast from oldest to newest without
creating a station?? Mind you, this podcast has been inactive for years so there is no worry
about new material coming in to screw up the order of the episodes.

Anyway, I was fed up with Apple Podcasts and wanted to know how all these podcast apps know
what podcasts are out there. Turns out most podcasters subscribe to a hosting service like
[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/?referrer_id=98725). The most basic hosting service
stores the recording, exposes a RSS (people said it was dead...not sure if all hosting services
use RSS / XML) feed of your episodes for podcast apps like Spotify or Apple or Stitcher, and
provides basic analytics (listener count, download count, etc). In order for your podcast to
get into Apple's oh so amazing ecosystem of $1000 devices, you have to submit your RSS feed
and wait for approval. Spotify, same thing. Probably every other podcast app on the planet
also uses RSS. Now you know how the system works.
