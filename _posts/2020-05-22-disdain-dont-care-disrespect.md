One scenario that's been crawling in my skin recently is dealing with people
who just don't care. No matter what you do to try to motivate them, to get them
to see the big picture, to tie some consequences of what we're working on back
to their lives, they couldn't be bothered to be productive. You may also know
them as _deadbeats_ or freeloaders, though I'm not sure there's a name for the
most insidious kind who actively tries to bring down the group rather than
just not holding up their end of the work.

Thankfully, I am not currently dealing with anybody of this nature. But I have
been that insubordinate person and I've done enough damn school group projects
to know how frustrating it is to have these people around.

I don't think this post actually contains much practical advice on how to
resolve discipline or insubordination issues. This is more just a space for me
to mull over what it looks like to have enough balls to nip these people in the
bud.

My initial thoughts on this problem were to try to eliminate the possibility of
such people appearing in an otherwise productive setting:
1. With such an attitude, such people may not get hired in the first place.
But that ignores the possibility that this attitude develops after they take a
job or that they're good enough at hiding their destructive tendencies during
the ritual of the interview cycle.
2. If such a person is unproductive or otherwise demonstrates incompetence, they
could be fired. The issue here is that firing takes some time and maybe there's
other office politics or HR "process" that will make it hard to get rid of them.
3. If the person has a bad attitude but is a good performer, maybe you can throw
your hands up and let them be. This assumes they aren't actively dragging down
other people on the team, which sounds like an unlikely assumption. Allowing
them relatively free rein may also set a bad precedent for dealing with people
like this and cause problems with future hires who have to interact with that
person. Another risk is that that person may be so productive and so responsible
for critical portions of the effort that they become a information hub in the
group and thus also accumulate significant social leverage.

Funny how I thought about avoiding the problem first, given that I knew from
experience that there are cases where there are no easy ways to immediately do
anything about these people. Sometimes it's more responsible to complete the
project then duke it out.

Probably the most effective way to deal with these toxic people is to cut them
out like a tumor. The other plan is to work with the individual (it's almost
always an individual, or at least there is a leader of the lazy buttholes) on a
performance rehabilitation plan. I'm inclined to believe that people are
generally hard to recover from such a brink. Part of my bias is that I don't
think I have sufficient skills or energy to work on root causing why exactly
this person is on the fritz and helping them get back to a point where they can
contribute without causing a mess. Even if you do have the skills and energy to
handle such a case, it's not clear that there's a good expected return on
investment (I'm going off a totally unfounded gut intuition of probably 2/3 of
these cases won't recover).

^ I'm assuming the employee is practically incurable at this point. It does take
some judgement to see if the employee how bad the situation is and whether some
coaching and encouragement will resolve the issue...That's an exercise in life
and management that only the reader can really figure out how to solve.

The risks for leaving these people untreated is that they infect the other
people in the team or otherwise destabilize the effort through their downward
spiral into self destructiveness and mental instability. Of course, getting rid
of the person may not help if they somehow have social allies within the group
and thus can still exert negative pressure on the team.

I have this impression that sports teams tend to go with removing the
*insubordinate* player from the team, invoking the idea that being on the team
is a "privilege". Initial infractions may be treated with temporary suspensions
of play. Only when the behavior is sustained or sufficiently damaging to team
morale will they be permanently removed. While that player is faced with the
great existential question of "who am I when I can no longer play sports", they
apparently should come to terms with their desire to play sports and how awful
their negative behavior is. I don't know what the rehabilitation rate is, but
I'm not sure it's high. A *punishment* like benching could infuriate the toxic
person, making them even harder to deal with. I think the biggest risk here,
as with perhaps all strategies that involve delicate social situations, is the
strength of the coach, leader, parent, etc. A weak leader will give in to the
toxic person's pleas to be let back in or otherwise be fooled by their beguiling
behavior, rendering the removal ineffective. A big mistake many parents make
when delivering discipline or punishment is not following through on their
statements. If you don't demonstrate commitment to take difficult action, why
should they trust or respect you? It gives them all the more reason to toy with
you and take advantage of you, until you break and resort to physical violence
or incoherent shouting. At that point, you could either be presented to *your*
superior as incompetent or simply abandoned, left to mull over your failure to
dominate this one beastly student of yours.

I suppose the question at this point is, "are you a competent leader"? Did this
person get into this state themselves or is it because of
[your bad management](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7413904)? Did you set
clear goals? Did you allow your subordinate sufficient autonomy? Are you
consistent and principled in your actions? Do you protect your people from
bureaucratic hogwash? Do you recognize your people for good work? Do you enforce
policies that ensure their mental and physical health? Do you demonstrate
genuine care for them? Do you encourage them to work on challenging tasks and
achieve their goals? Do you support them in their independent initiatives? Do
you make sure work is evenly spread and that everybody is working on things
that will build long term strength of the team (infrastructure improvements,
documentation, knowledge transfers)? Are you leading by example and improving
the morale? It's not easy being a manager or a leader.

Looks like the takeaways here are nothing more than what you'd get on a
[reputable site like
Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-handle-an-insubordinate-employee).
As the leader, you need to take care of figuring out the root cause for the
behavior, helping the employee get back on track, and worst case, firing them.
Thank you for reading this far anyway...

Note 1: One of the assumptions we make when dealing with people is that they are
fundamentally good. [Hanlon's
Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) builds on this assumption
by advising: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by
stupidity. I don't have a way of refuting this claim, but I'm not sure why
this emphasis on trust is so high when it seems like trust in suburban
neighborhoods is not particularly high. Surely it's not just my family that's
overly cautious about being friendly with the neighbors. Thiel would argue that
pre-Enlightenment, [we believed in the weakness of the will and the power of
the intellect; we have now reversed that
relation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8). I want to say that gives
people a bias towards rehabilitation and working with the affected person one on
one, but I'm not sure that's a feeling that's founded upon anything.
