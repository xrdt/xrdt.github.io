The conventional theory is that perception, esp. vision, is only useful
when it is accurate. The perceptual system thus tries to recreate the
objective world as closely as possible in its internal representation.
Hoffman's argument is that evolution optimizes for fitness. Fitness and
accuracy of perception do not necessarily have a strong connection. You can
imagine an infinite number of mappings between fitness and perception, where
an isomorphism between the perceptual model and objective reality is one.
Hoffman's argument is that perception is an interface to reality, just as
GUIs for operating systems are interfaces to the transistors and diodes making
up your computer's internals. Is the GUI at all an accurate representation
of the motherboard? No. Is it useful for in the environment of helping people
tell the computer do things? Yes. Then this interface achieves its objective.
Hoffman gives a couple of examples of supernormal stimuli to motivate the
idea that perception can't possibly be accurate. One such example is that
jewel beetles like to copulate with empty, brown beer bottles. They use the
satisficing criteria of brown, shiny, and dimpled to evaluate the quality of
their mates, and it just happens to be that beer bottles are pretty brown,
shiny, and dimpled. You might argue that our perception of supernormal stimuli
is colored by our perceptual system, which also its flaws. But, given that the
beetle who rubs its genitals all over the beer bottle fails to meet its
objective of copulating with a female jewel beetle, we can say that it at
least isn't perceiving reality well. Hoffman concludes the paper with a simple
interface game simulation that shows that the simple strategy far outperforms
the truth seeking strategy. In response to the conjecture that as perceptual
systems and corresponding behaviors increase in complexity, we may find a
truth-seeking perceptual system, Hoffman says there emerge "None of interest".
