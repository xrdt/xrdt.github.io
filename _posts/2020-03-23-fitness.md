Ok, I've done all of these things with some sense of regularity over the years. I'm more into the
body weight stuff right now, but I'll likely get back into weights once I have my own indoor space to store
kettlebells and (hopefully) barbells or dumbells. I've been thinking about purchasing a storage container to
serve as my personal gym space, but am currently not sure about the land. Would love to chat with people
about storage container development or property dev in general.

If you're looking for a coach, I highly highly highly recommend my former high school strength and conditioning
coach [Casey Wheel](https://twitter.com/coachwheel). The link on his Twitter is only looking for adolescents for
online training, but he's for sure responsive to DMs if you want a quick workout plan or short consultation about
your fitness objectives and strategy. His [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/coachwheel) also has tons of short
videos with fitness challenges and routines.

Equipment:
* You.
* Your will power and commitment.
* Gymnastic rings (optional, but these are dang powerful tools if you have a place to hang them)
* Kettlebell (optional, but helps if you want to work on power-based movements like snatches and swings)
* Adjustable weight dumbbell (optional, but helps strength and hypertrophy gains come faster)
* Pull up bar (optional, especially if you have rings, but pull ups are a nice exercise to work on)
* Barbell (super optional, but it's the classic tool of weightlifters. Squat baby, squat)
* Battle ropes (super optional, but fun and great for cardio / power / imbalances / range of motion)
* Plyometric box (super optional, but nice if you want to increase vertical or generic leg power and fast twitch)
