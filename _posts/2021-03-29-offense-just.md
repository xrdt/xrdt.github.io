Offensive uses of the word "just" sentence templates:
* "Just ..."
* "Why don't you just .... ?"
* "It's so easy. Just [add water?] ..."
* "It's just ..."

Some examples of how to complete the templates in an offensive
(哼，你若沒有我這麼沒耐心、敏感、脾氣差、受夠等你可以說這些舉例都只是 annoying)
way:
* Just Google it
* Just get up and get dressed and move on with your day
* Why don't you just exercise more and eat less?
* Why don't you just try thinking fewer sad thoughts?
* It's so easy. Just watch how I do it.
* It's not that hard. Just balance the spinning plate on your head while hanging
  the laundry.
* It's [really] just not that hard. It's just that simple.

([More than] A bit peeved that Nike has claimed "Just Do It" for their
pro-athleticism propaganda and, through highly sophisticated marketing
techniques, injected a singular, get-your-blood-pumping connotation of that
phrase so deep into my brain [and, I suppose, the cultural lexicon] that I must
hesitate to put "Just do it" as an example into the above list because I
immediately think about the Nike swoosh and all the low body fat percentage,
stone-faced models they take pictures of and plaster all over their website.
A-hem.)

Yes, sometimes when I receive a "just" sentence of the above sort, I am whining
and deserve to be told off. Yes, sometimes, it really is "just" that easy and
I've been operating in brain-blocked mode. Yes, sometimes, "just" taking your
prescribed course of action will produce some magical psychosomatic
neurotransmitter hormone cocktail that resolves my issue. But really, what irks
me about these uses of "just" is the (not at all veiled) [disdain, contempt,
disgust, frustration, dismissiveness] that emanates out from the "just" giver.
It's this sense that (going down the list of examples above) you think I'm too
stupid to Google this myself (I probably already did Google and ran into
roadblocks) or that I'm "just" a lazy ass (I'm sorry, but maybe I've lost my
desire to play the game of life) or maybe I have a food addiction or maybe my
value system has become warped to the point where I can't think myself out of
having thoughts or despair or darkness or maybe it's really not that easy and
you're being an arrogant ass because you just want to rub what you see as my
"stupidity" or "incompetence" or "laziness" (yes, this damn "excuse" again) in
my face. (Come back on another day, when I've taken another pass on this piece,
and you might find it less vitriolic. And perhaps [my
countenance](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1151588211090608128) will have
improved.)

All of the negative qualifiers I used to describe the attitude of the person
using the above "offensive justs" (disdain, contempt, disgust, frustration,
dismissiveness) are examples of disrespect. I've put on the [front page of this
site](http://xrdt.github.io) that "respect is the foundation". I have no better
thoughts or advice to share with those you seeking a precise definition of
respect from me than to say that you should know yourself whether you respect
another and that you should work to hone, in addition to your bullshit detector,
your detector for whether others respect you (actions speak louder than words).
You should also develop your confidence and ability to take down those who
refuse to demonstrate respect. "Bad actors are not sufficiently penalised for
the far-reaching consequences of their
[actions](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1094894798106816513)". The world
could use more
[sheepdogs](https://www.killology.com/sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs). I applaud
those who respect themselves, who respect others, who surround themselves with
those who respect them. I celebrate those who take the additional step to fight
the never-ending fight against disrespect and all that disrespect leads people
to do.

To those who use "sometimes a firm hand is needed" as an excuse to mistreat
others: Respect is a distinct, tonal, attitudinal axis to the actions you could
take. You can coach someone aggressively with or without respect. You can greet
someone with or without respect. You can ask a favor of someone with or without
respect. You can only repeatedly ghost someone if you don't respect them. You
can only repeatedly "forget to notify someone" of a schedule change if you don't
respect them. You can only drop the ball on a relationship if you don't respect
them or the effort required to maintain and build that relationship. You can
only repeatedly hurt others (is there any other way to hurt someone than to
overstep their boundaries?) if you don't respect them. You can only dismiss
their concerns or frustrations or struggles if you don't respect how they move
through the world. So please don't ever use this excuse to be an asshole towards
those who have not violated your expectations for respect and decency in
interactions. Don't forget that acceptance is not predicated upon understanding.

Talk](https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/0380811960)<br>
Honestly, this book would sell so much more if it were renamed "How to Talk".
The principles outlined in this book around listening with full attention when
your children (ahem, other people) talk, helping give others vocabulary (another
post needs to come to elucidate my views on the power of labels as crisp points
around which people can reflexively update how they think about the labeled
thing and how accurately the label reflects their internal experience or
representation of the world) with which to describe their perceptions,
acknowledging what another tells you by reflecting what they say back at them,
honestly and transparently revealing your feelings about what they're telling
you, respecting their struggles, giving them space in which to come up with
their own problems to their solutions (asking too many questions might cause
them to shut down), encouraging them to look for external solutions (not you) to
their problems, working collaboratively with them to come up with [mutually
acceptable solutions to mutual
problems](http://emotionalanarchism.com/widening-the-bridges-beyond-consent-and-autonomy-emmi/),
modeling better behavior, and giving them opportunities to see themselves in a
different light than the one they light to shine upon themselves are all
principles for mature and [productive
communication](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1333921846811570182)
("There is no such thing as a productive discussion that alienates its
parties.")

Here are your responsibilities:
* It is your responsibility (to the world) to begin every interaction with
  respect.
* It is your responsibility (to the world, to those you care about, to
  yourself), [when you feel safe to do
  so](https://www.killology.com/sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs), to nip disrespect
  (and contempt and disdain and its ugly brothers) in the bud.
* It is your responsibility (to yourself, to the world) to cultivate respect in
  those within your circle of influence and elevate the behavior of those in
  your tribe.
* It is your responsibility (to yourself) to [swiftly end any interactions that
  do not operate on terms of respect](https://twitter.com/nooxandcrannies/status/1362515947907649537)
  and reciprocity and eventual amplification of the participants' energy.
