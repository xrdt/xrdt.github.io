__Programming Paradigms__:
* Finally someone gives a really principled answer for when [OOP really shows
  its
  weaknesses](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-OOP/answers/72342560)
  * And here's [another answer that's second
   tier](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-OOP/answer/Adam-Hartline)
    but far above the "well OOP is bad if you use it improperly" people.
  * OOP demands a strict bond between a behavior (verb) and the state of an
    object (noun).
    * Anytime there's not a great 1 : 1 mapping behavior and state, OOP breaks
      down.
  * Functional languages are all about behaviors as the fundamental unit of
    thought. You want an output state as defined by an input state that is
    achieved by a behavior.
  * Remember that OOP and any other programming paradigms are about making it
    easier for humans to reason about and control the world. Every mental model
    has flaws. It's important to develop an understanding of where those flaws
    are, when they may hurt you, and how hard it will be to change models when
    the current one becomes untenable.

  * It's built on Pharo!
* Changing how database people think about storing [data from the
  edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08473.pdf)
  * [Related blog on

    treating user phones as the source of truth, rather than a central server
    in a client-server model as the source of truth.

__Tech Bros__:
* [Public Space, Quarantine, Our Embodied Presence and How Big Tech Wants
  Humans to Interact](https://reallifemag.com/home-screens/)
  * From the awesome Drew Austin of Kneeling Bus.

  <br>---<br>

  > transactional and trust is difficult if not impossible without surveillance
  > and ratings schemes. The traditional solidarity of geographically situated
  > communities and the reciprocity they cultivate are ruled out.

* Dumbing down the mind [by using hot
  buzzwords](https://uxdesign.cc/poster-prompts-for-avoiding-design-isms-8be43625c482)
  that no one really understands but everyone knows.

__Organizational Design__:
* [Designing and sticking to
  policies](https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/)
  * Constraints should actually constrain. The cost of writing (and enforcing,
    let's not forget) a policy is high. Reduce the future headaches that result
    from this policy by making it easy to implement. For example, "Teams are
    staffed in at most one office."
  * Why is it hard to enforce policies?
    * Accepting reduced opportunity space
    * Locally suboptimal
      * Related is patio11 saying that [he yearns for the independent lifestyle
        once a month at
        Stripe](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/). All
        part of optimizing for company wide leverage.
  * What do you do when the magnitude of exceptions you want to grant exceeds
    your ability to rationalize and enforce the existing policy?
    * Record the exceptions and the circumstances carefully so you have
      sufficient context to adjust the policy on a regular cadence, like every
      month. Accept the constance of change and your inability to design a
      system that is fully dynamic by building in times of reorganization to a
      new reality.
      * This is an important release valve for people who raised the exceptions
        and for you as the system designer. It also engenders trust among
        everybody in the system that their opinions are carefully regarded and
        acted upon.
* [What to optimize for over the 40 - 45 years of your
  career](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/)
  * How to not think about your career through the drab, Silicon Valley
    endorsed formula of "get rich quick by switching between fast track
    companies".
  * Pace
    > building continued depth and expertise requires remaining in the same
    > environment for multiple years, which makes long-term energy management
    > an essential part of skill development.
    * How do you evaluate whether you are outpacing yourself:
    > how long does it take on a vacation or weekend until you stop feeling
    > anxious, and how anxious do you start feeling when you think about
    > returning to work on Monday?
  * People
    * Your network is your lifeline into the professional world from the moment
      you enter it.
  * Prestige
    * You can manufacture prestige by writing or speaking or otherwise making
      your good thoughts visible. Thank and curse the internet for making it
      that much easier for you (and everybody else, curse competition) to get
      your word out.
    > Prestige makes everything more attainable: a universal lubricant.
  * Profit
    * As you move up the ladder, it will take longer for you to find the right
      roles. Time is money, so it really helps to be financially sustainable
      for at least 6 months (1 year is better) if you need to find a new job.
    > that financial flexibility allows you to be deliberate about creating
    > opportunities to invest into yourself and your career.
    * Financial stability is readily achieved through a boring spend little,
      save a lot strategy.
  * Learning
    * Learn deep and learn broad. Work on things and reflect on them.
  * [Writing a career narrative](https://lethain.com/career-narratives/)
    > Go somewhere that's disproportionately valuable to you because of who you
    > are and what you want.
    * ^Thielian anti competitive stance.
* [PG on Schlep Blindness](http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html), or that
  unconscious and instinctive shying away from things you predict to be tedious
  or unpleasant, even if they're highly valuable (e.g. building a digital
  payments company).

__Smart People Explaining Things__:
* [The Kelly Criterion](http://www.elem.com/~btilly/kelly-criterion/)
* [China's secret army of academic spies debunked](https://twitter.com/calebwatney/status/1255585570283192320)
* [Some services exist](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1255371954443505665)
  and are bought because they eliminate the low single digit million dollar
  cost of an engineering team.

  sting operation on public corruption.

__Good Writing__:
* Finally, the first [good piece of
  anything](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/fran-lebowitz-is-never-leaving-new-york)
  I've read in months. I felt like I was wasting an inordinate amount of time
  reading non technical Internet articles in college; I realize now how helpful
  reading all kinds of largely good writing helped me maintain my intellectual
  vibrancy. This piece is an interview with a woman I wish I had know about
  earlier: Fran Lebowitz. Below, some quotes:
  > I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to think about this (note: not
  *feel*), because it is a very startling thing to be my age -- I'm sixty nine
  -- and to have something happen that doesn't remind you of anything else.
  <br>---<br>
  > I'm more concerned with how we will know this is over.
  <br>---<br>
  > Usually, the not very hard work is the most remunerative.
  <br>---<br>
  > Giulani was the first person I remember who started this kind of poisonous
  > politics of nostalgia, which is really just racism, at its core.
* Finally found this freaking quote from Yudkowsky:
  > Take actions such that you would be glad to receive the news that you had
  > taken them
* Drew Austin on meatspace in quarantine
  > As the American urban environment has grown increasing privatized,
  > consumption has been the primary way to engage with it. Spaces where we can
  > do anything other than eat, drink, shop, or exercise have diminished
  <br>---<br>
   > In New York, the parts of the city that aren’t defined by consumption are
   > specifically what’s still open
