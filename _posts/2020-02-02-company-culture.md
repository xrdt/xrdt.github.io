Here's a page to record thoughts I have about what it takes to build good
company culture. "You" are the leader / CEO / cultural guru of this organization.

Culture Objective: To build a culture where people can do the best work of their lives,
hopefully for the rest of their careers.

Thoughts:
2020-02-02 (I am still having a lot of trouble writing 2020 as the year..)
* I'm listening to [Joel Pearson's](https://twitter.com/ProfJoelPearson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
[Future Minds podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/future-minds/id1477300507) with [Ed Catmull](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/001-ed-catmull-pixar-on-creativity-innovation-at-lucas/id1477300507?i=1000447415785).
Everybody knows Pixar is brilliant but the stories Ed tells about letting
outrageous people do outrageous but harmless things so that the company learns
that it's safe to take risks is absolutely brilliant. If you believe fear of
failure is the main reason for a dearth of creativity among adults, it's a
no-brainer that Pixar's strategy has let it be an absolute monster in computer
animation and computer animated film-making (though I have been long saying that
there's likely been mean reversion between [Disney animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_features) and
[Pixar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films) after the
acquisition). But you can't just expect that culture to self-propagate. Ed talks
about what happens when the original crew "grows up", settles down, starts having
kids and going home at 5pm so they can fulfill their family obligations. At that
point, stories about the good old days when people would reassemble cars in common
spaces or hold crazy parties until midnight at the office are just stories. How do
you make sure the torch of the culture you've built so far gets carried on? Ed's
solution is to chat with some of the original musketeers privately and have them
encourage more fun-making and camaraderie-building from the bottom-up.
* Here's an interesting thought: [preference falsification](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674707580).
Tensions within a company
can ferment quietly...very quietly. Sometimes people go along with the crowd and
against their preferences because the cost of standing out and being the tall poppy
is greater than quietly suffering and taking a painkiller later (or not). No matter
how careful you are to field any and all questions during all-hands or eat lunch with
random sub-sub-sub^n-ordinates every quarter or manage by walking through the office,
preference falsification and people not speaking straight to you will eventually
happen. It's up to you to know how to navigate the social vagaries of your org
or hire someone with integrity who will alert you to such issues and help you
empower those at the leverage points to restore balance.
* One other point in Ed made in his podcast with Joel Pearson was that Pixar has
been consistently [publishing their research](https://graphics.pixar.com/research/). Neither George Lucas nor Steve Jobs
(who is known for his secrecy at Apple) blocked them on this initiative. Frankly,
this initiative has been a huge boon for Pixar in terms of recruiting because it
means that great candidates all *know* that Pixar is doing cool stuff. Ed's thinking
here was that Pixar was really far away from its goal, so it could only be beneficial
to be open and engage with the community and let people take credit for their work
by being listed on published articles. This panned out nicely because Pixar has
been getting the best people for a long time now.
* I love to [tell candidates](../../../2019/11/23/thoughtspot-engineering.html) that people at
[ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com) are genuinely interested
in each others' personal development and in the development of the company. I
believe this kind of culture can only be good. How do you build an environment where
competitive tendencies get channeled in the proper ways? You listen. You genuinely
care. You bring your whole self to work. You acknowledge and reward people for good
work and for stepping above and beyond their stated responsibilities. You filter in
the hiring pipeline for people who demonstrate integrity, a genuine interest in
engaging with the company's vision for at least 5 years, and the discipline to get
things done.
* How do you build an efficient and effective pipeline between customers -> sales
team -> PMs (product manager) -> engineers? The things you are trying to avoid here
are: feature bloat, poor quality of releases, unmotivated engineers, falling behind
the competition. PMs are a filtering function from the front lines to
your engineers and PR from your engineers to the front lines. PMs are also synthesizers.
They are responsible for taking in a bunch of ideas about specifications for new features,
metrics on the health of the business, presentations on competitive intelligence, and turning
that into a X-week execution plan for something that will hopefully delight your customers
and bring in the dollars. It is important that PMs can speak both tech and business at minimum,
because any friction between the PM and your devs or your designers or your salespeople or your
senior leadership will slow down progress. One thing that perhaps is important to consider is
how much you want to facilitate interaction between product engineers and the customer. It's
important to be grounded in what is actually important to customers but it is also important to
focus on creation and research and all the good building things that product engineers can
and should do.
* ["Unless you own the company, the company owns you" -- Zach Holman reflecting on getting
fired from GitHub](https://zachholman.com/talk/firing-people). Is this always the case,
even at the smallest stages of company
building? Misalignment between employees and the owners / board / etc is inevitably going
to arise once the company becomes a legit company. Unless it's just two of you working
out of a garage as independent consultants or just starting up a business, there's bound to
be different visions for the company and different incentives for being involved in the
endeavor. Treat everyone with respect and be fair to *all* your employees. Separate the
body politic from your personal relations with each employee, but don't
lose your humanity. Your career is long and people remember how you treated them, especially
during times when the payoffs could be drastically uneven (selling the company, taking on
new investment, reorgs, etc). The founders of [Matician](https://matician.com) easily come to mind as
people who've treated their subordinates and colleagues fairly through all stages of their careers.
Matician is also working on cool stuff...
