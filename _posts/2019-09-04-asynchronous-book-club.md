A coworker today was talking about his latest book find:
"The Road to Wigan Pier", a nonfiction account of Orwell's time among working
class North Englishmen. Eventually, I was asked about my latest readings,
which was
["The Rise of the Meritocracy"](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/10/11/the-far-side-of-meritocracy/),
by Michael Young. We chatted a bit about the Rise of the Meritocracy and then
I was asked what I was reading
[next](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Hidden_Since_the_Foundation_of_the_World)...
which led to
[this conversation](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1169484589175173120).
At some point, my lunch group started talking about
[Ruth Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg). I have a
feeling that my manager heavily leans towards bringing up female leaders and
female empowerment things around me. I'm the only female engineer on the
team...and I just joined...a month ago. There's nothing wrong with his
behavior, but I'm negatively invested in the feminist movement. Honestly,
I'm trying to [dedupe](https://medium.com/@rljunco/eric-weinsteins-four-quadrant-model-the-knife-media-6e642ff3f54b) on the feminist movement and thus am
very aloof and distant around these topics. Back to the point. We start
talking about Ruth and how she wrote an [autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Own-Words-Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg/dp/150114524X) and how it's unclear whether
these books are any good or whether they just get a bunch of attention
because someone famous wrote them. Ahem
[Michelle Obama's book](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136) (which I haven't read so don't chew me out for it).

The next author of attack on this popular author but mediocre writer is
Malcolm Gladwell, whom I hate for his wishy-washy nice journalism but heavy
confirmation bias and hand waviness that should only be reserved for math
proofs and textbooks where the author says repeatedly that the proof is
trivial or practically falls right off the page or that the exercise is left
for the reader. Talking about Malcolm Gladwell reminded me of my favorite,
data-heavy book: [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Functions-publications/dp/019261682X). There is a newer "Why We Sleep", but it's utter
garbage and Malcolm Gladwell-Michael Lewis style wishy washiness. The old
"Why We Sleep" basically summarizes a bunch of research studies on sleep and
its effects on body temperature, cognitive performance, weight of rats and
humans. It's a dense book, but it's so satisfying to read because you know
you're getting the real stuff, straight from the source. My main takeaways
from that book:
* Your cognitive performance deteriorates after 1 night w/o sleep.
* Your body doesn't really need sleep. Your brain does.
* You can safely and permanently reduce your sleep hours to 6 - 7 hours
(I need to check those numbers but that's pretty much the range for average
people. Also, I safely and permanently, not painlessly).
* Your body temperature decreases as you become more sleep deprived.
* People tend to eat a lot more when sleep deprived but not gain weight.
Anyway, I highly recommend the *real* OG "Why We Sleep". Get it from your
local library.

Back to the point. My coworker who's reading Orwell said he once read a book
as part of a book club that was utter garbage but was written by some
celebrity prof or who know what. Yadda yadda, my thinking was immediately
drawn towards the idea of a book club. I did book clubs in school, but those
were easy because everybody had to show up and do the work to get the credit.
We were also heavily supervised. I'm now super disinclined to join book clubs
because of the social coordination costs and because I'm increasingly
misanthropic and picky about the kind of intellectual environment I want to
immerse myself into (cue Peter Thiel and Eric Weistein and Alexey Guzey and
Devon Zuegel as prime examples of people I want to be more like). Anyway, the
social costs of a book club:
* Bad book selection
* Slow reading pace. I think most book clubs read a book every 2 wks to 1
month? Of course, people are *busy* and have jobs and have kids and spend
too much time on their phones to read. But a book a week is 52 books a year,
which is potentially an exponential increase in knowledge gained and mental
scaffolding built over reading at half to 1/4 the pace.
* People have to show up and organize and bring food and drinks and play nice
with each other. Too much effort.
* Discussion is likely nonsense. I don't really appreciate discussions (I went
to a high school that encouraged discussion by putting us around this idiotic
table called a [Harkness table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkness_table).
I am a shy person, which doesn't help, but the discussions were, as
expected, dominated by the same five people every class and often weren't
very illuminating in the way that I want to become). The principle I'm pulling
upon here is: don't call a meeting unless you have to; only call the minimum
number of people. Sure, it's good to be social, but I don't have the patience
for social drivel and cocktail banter any more.

So, my solution to the social costs of a book club is: make it asynchronous.
Simply, this means that things don't happen in real time. They don't happen
simultaneously. They happen when people get to them. They don't happen when
people don't get to them, and that's fine. How do you implement an
asynchronous book club? I think that's what everybody smart is doing on the
Internet: share a book list on their personal website. This basically means,
I endorse these books. It might be too strong to assume these people
intimately know the contents of each book they recommend, but they probably
are familiar enough with each book to be able to carry on a smart conversation
about it. So, if you also like that book and have questions you want to ask
the person who is sharing that book their site, you can send them an email.
They may or may not respond, but if you do get a response, you've now begun
a meaningful discussion about "Snow White", for example.

So, perhaps this post is banal. Perhaps it echoes words that were more
eloquently pieced together about
[networking on the Internet](https://guzey.com/how-to-make-friends-over-the-internet/),
for example. Perhaps I'm a late, declining adopter of a strategy that people
have been using for centuries (pen pals, anyone?). Regardless, I hope you
found a couple of good books in this post that we can chat about (through
email, please) next time.
