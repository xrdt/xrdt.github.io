I joined [Thoughtspot](http://thoughtspot.com) on August 5th, 2019. The
original start date was July 1, but I pushed it back to [spend more time
with my family](../../07/04/reflections-on-china.html).

[Here's why I chose this company](../../04/27/how-i-chose-among-job-offers-fall-2018.html).

The company's founder and chairman, Ajeet, likes to say we are only 2% done.
[Our mission is to create a more fact-driven world through simple, yet easy to
use technology](https://www.thoughtspot.com/team). This reminds me of the
last sentence in Turing's
[*The Imitation Game*](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf):
> We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that
> needs to be done.

You may be more reminded of Bezo's "It's always Day 1 at Amazon" quip.

The company really likes to emphasize its culture of selfless excellence. I
have only seen confirmations that people at this company genuinely care about
the success of the venture and each other's personal successes.

[Rakesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkots/), my manager's manager, is a big
believer in the mission and has done a great job of articulating the vision
and how we will achieve it. It is very motivating to have him as a manager.

The bureaucracy is still minimal. We are ~500 strong and I have access to
most anyone's calendar, from
[Ajeet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajeetsinghmann/) to our
[SVP of Business Ops](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-freeman-16b1393/) to
our [Controller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raquelpeasley/). More
adminstrative and non-tech teams like HR, recruiting, and sales / marketing
are downstairs in our new Sunnyvale office and the engineers, IT, PMs,
documentation, and finance teams are upstairs.

The company is at an inflection point in its growth cycle. We have been around
for 7 years (the max age at which LinkedIn will let us call ourselves a
startup) and have raised a Series E valuing us at ~$2 bil. We are officially
late-stage. We have also hired
[Bob Baxley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbaxley/) to be our new Senior VP of
Design and Experience. We have established product-market fit, we've proven
our value proposition through technical superiority (scale and speed at which
our in-house database, Falcon, is able to operate, which is billions of rows
at millisecond speed) and are now shifting towards a more
customer-focused perspective. This does not mean that we stop thinking about
the technical quality suffers. It just means that the framing of questions
and our priorities and our structure shifts a bit. We added PMs like
[Dave Eyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityachand/) just under 2 years ago,
which shows how recently we moved into more product-growth, user-growth,
deepen our roots position. The PMs are doing great work and I really respect
how hard they dogfood our product and how they are driving engineering to
greater success.

I've been working on bugs and small tasks up to now. I work on the search
engine, which is responsible for surfacing suggestions as users type into our
search bar. In case our website isn't clear, we have built a search interface
for relational data. The long term vision is to be the place where people go
to interact with structured data, in much the same way that people go to
Google to interact with unstructured text data and geographic data. My team
has treated me well. We are now working on initiatives that will allow us to
have greater insight into customer usage so we can give smarter suggestions.
We are at an inflection point where the infrastructure and core functionality
has become stable enough for us to start building compute pipelines on top
of it. I expect more machine learning and data analysis demand to emerge over
the next year.

We get free lunch each day. It's a minor thing, basically expected in this
era, but it makes it easy for teams to eat together and bond. Food is pretty
healthy.

The company has invested a lot in revamping and polishing its technical
bootcamp, which is for customers / partners and new employees. It covers
most everything end users would want to know about the product, from data
loading to system architecture to making worksheets to sharing pinboards to
setting security levels. It felt grueling and boring in the moment, but I
appreciate that the company invests that time, money, and effort in us. It's a
great way to ground new employees in the experience of the software.

My commute is about 6mi, 20min each way. It goes along Central Expressway, so
I never experience any real traffic in the morning. If I leave between
5:30 - 7pm, I will suffer traffic at Central Expressway x Mary. The
intersections in this part of town are highly inconvenient, often requiring
you to take a level changing loop to get onto another road.

Do I think that I made the right choice in joining this company? I was more
bushy-eyed when I first joined, but I think this was a good choice. This
company has given me the best working experience of my life. I am looking
forward to the next series of milestones and breakthroughs the company will
achieve.

Our [Beyond](https://www.thoughtspot.com/beyond2019) conference is next week.
We have a lot of new features we are excited to launch, and I'm looking
forward to seeing the attendees ooh and aah over our improvements.
