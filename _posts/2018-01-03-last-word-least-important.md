title: "The Last Word is the Least Important"

One of my high school friends once told our friend group that the last word of each sentence been statistically found to be the least important in constructing the sentence meaning. To test this idea, she proceeded to omit the last word from every sentence she spoke to us for the rest of the day. Being silly kids with no real commitment to rigorously testing this claim, we disputed this statistical mumbo jumbo every couple of sentences she spoke. I joined in on the madness, just to see what it felt like to cut myself off on every sentence. The experiment quickly stopped, and we soon went back to speaking like normal people.

Because we’re talking about language, I’d like to remind everybody about the all important completely intuitive [English order of adjectives](http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/order-of-adjectives/).
