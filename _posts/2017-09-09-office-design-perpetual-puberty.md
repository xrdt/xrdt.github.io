I was so tired yesterday that I forgot to write a post, instead wasting my time cleaning out my email by reading some backlogged newsletters. I actually had my folder of posts open, waiting for another post to join the list. I’m going to make up for my incompetence and lack of discipline by writing today and tomorrow.

My early-morning internship schedule will soon come to an end, and I could not be happier for that fact. Starting the work day between 7 and 8 am slowly destroyed me with sleep deprivation, and as I worked more and more days, I started to show up later and later. I just couldn’t bear to wake up at 6:30am anymore. Eventually 7am became the new normal. Then 7:30am became the new normal because I stopped eating breakfast before work and would hastily pack some potatoes and bacon or sausage and fruit into Starbucks cups and eat them at my desk. I think it’s better for me to show up to work late and stay later than everybody else. While I do enjoy the feeling of getting off work at a time when the sun is still out and the animals are still scurrying around, I like the peace and quiet of an empty office better. I like it because when I’m in my cubicle when everybody else is around, I get nervous and anxious, thinking that every noise and rustle means someone is watching what I’m doing and passing judgement on my productivity. I am now strongly in favor of offices for everybody, preferably with windows and oriented so people are facing away from the door.

This designed is inspired by some articles on office design and posts on hackernews about people debating the merits of open-office and remote-office structures. Some companies, like stackoverflow have also committed to offices for everybody. There was a [particularly good article](https://coderbyheart.com/office-design-by-an-office-hater/) which included a cool 3-D floor plan where offices had space for three or size people, and there were private areas for one to two people and a big space which could fit everybody for meetings and lunches and other gatherings. That was cool, but I think the private office with glass walls was probably the best.

I understand that many people feel strongly about maintaining the open stream of questions and banter and eavesdropping that comes with an open-office. But I will argue that most offices don’t need that kind of environment. Chat on Slack or Skype or whatever productivity you use if you need to give someone an impromptu tap on the shoulder. Especially for my current company, everybody’s work is so independent that we rarely ever need to speak to each other seriously about work. If your team is small and very interdependent, perhaps the three to an office structure mentioned in the above paragraph will be better. If you’re a startup without the money to give everybody an office, buy some Shoji screens and split up the space. Put in carpet to reduce noise and let everybody immerse themselves into their ideal productivity environments.

Your people are your most important assets. Do not treat them like fodder to be fed into your money-making machine. Do not spout impressive values while taking actions that clearly violate every single egalitarian, humanitarian, meritocracy supporting principle you put in some slides and on your website. Your values are determined by the decisions you make, especially by the decisions you make about the people you keep in your company.

Treat your employees with respect. Give them the resources they need to succeed.

我最近一直覺得我的工作很沒意思。尤其是我暑期實習快結束了，所以剛過的禮拜都在準備把我寫的程序交換給我老闆。我最討厭做這種需要很仔細的處理事。調試也是非常傷腦經的一件事，我的程序差不多做好了，那幾個故障我才不想管了。所以我前兩天就開始用工作時間做自己的項目了。

我這樣說的好像很有 vision，但我其實什麼都不知道。我完全不知道我對什麼東西特別有興趣，也不記得我的夢想放在哪裏，只知道我想掙脫束腹和責任，自由地遊蕩。生命好像是一種本來沒意思的活動，我們只是因為相信政府、錢、物品的價值才會簽約當某家公司的奴隸，把我們每一天的時間和精神給他們耍弄。有必要這樣做麽？我們的成就會從那裡出來嗎？你會因為工作上的業績得到真正滿意嗎？為什麼要因為這種東西驕傲呢？

生命中最重要的東西是你自己要找出來的。我最近對神合宗教比較有興趣，因為我覺得跟縱神的道可以讓我找出我真正的身份，我也認為神的道是真理。

永恆的生命。永恆的愛。永恆的恩惠。這都是只有神能賜給我們的。相信神，當神的信徒，你一定會得到拯救。你的家人、朋友也可以因神的愛而得到最有意義的生命。阿們。
