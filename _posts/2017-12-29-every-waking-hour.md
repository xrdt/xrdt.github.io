There is no need to maximize productivity in every waking hour. Each step you take should be towards some meaningful goal you have set to give your life purpose. Your life purpose should be set during a time when you are mentally unstressed, so you can make a good decision for your future self. Even if you don’t know what you want, you can at least set boundaries around what you don’t want.

Every person’s life has meaning and beauty. To compare your life to another’s is impossible because you cannot understand the nuances and details that make their life theirs. It is not a crime to be content, just as it is not a crime to be ambitious. But do not presume that one way is the ultimate way. Achieving greatness does not necessarily require ambition. It requires discipline, and perhaps ambition is that spark which makes discipline easier.

I feel as though my mind is wandering aimlessly through fertile fields of thought. But I am unable to step into any of those fields. I am content in watching the fields develop independently of me, for now.
