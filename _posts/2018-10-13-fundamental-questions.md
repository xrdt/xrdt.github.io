I frequently see people taking action without understanding whether their
course of action will resolve some fundamental questions.

For example, I see lots of startups who haven't answered the fundamental
questions of: Why should you exist?
Why will people find value in your product? What technical or business insight
have you made that will allow you to carve out a place to start in?

For example, I see lots of companies trying to recruit at Caltech who haven't
answered the fundamental questions of: Why will Caltech students want to work
here? Are Caltech students the kind of people I want to have in my company?
Do I have the infrastructure to support junior employees or to support
advanced employees coming out of academic environments?

For example, I see some Caltech clubs who are trying to improve engagement
and membership numbers without having answered the fundamental questions of:
Why should we exist? Why should Caltech students spend time with our club?
Do we have the right leadership to create the right kind of club environment
for members to thrive in? Are we targeting a subset of the population that
exists?

For example, I see people taking jobs without haven't answered the fundamental
questions of: Do I agree with the company's vision? Are they giving me an
opportunity to work on things that will fulfill me and allow me to develop my
faculties in a desirable way? Do I admire and respect the leadership of the
company? Do I admire and respect my coworkers?

Unless you have seen to the essence of an opportunity, of a plan, you surely
cannot achieve the most fulfilling results. And it is fine to fail, but you
must, afterwards, understand which fundamental question you failed to answer.

The lists of fundamental questions above are likely incomplete. I am happy to
receive inquiries regarding additions or revisions to the fundamental
questions.
