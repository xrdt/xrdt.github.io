title: "Abuses of Asynchronous Communication Methods"

Synchronous communication methods:
* Telephone calls
* Meeting in person
* Video calls

Asynchronous communication methods:
* Text messaging (FB Messenger, Google Hangouts)
* Slack
* Email
* Push notifications

How synchronous communication works:
* A calls B. B picks up and they chat for X minutes.
* A walks by B's desk. A calls B into his office. They chat for X minutes.

How asynchronous communication works (bad but it is the state of the world):
* A sends B a text. B gets a notification for it. B has notifications on all
the time because he feels that it's important not to miss out on every
(meme) text he gets from friends and thus responds immediately. If he
doesn't respond immediately or, worse, does the infamous "left on read", he
is reprimanded for his behavior by A at their next in-person meeting.
* A sends B an email. B is a conscientious human being and likes to be known
for fast responses, so he has Superhuman and notifications for everything on.
Thus, B responds immediately. B's email quality is sometimes bad because of
how rushed he is to get to Inbox Zero and stay on top of everything so he
adds a "sent from my iPhone, pardon typos" note to his signature. Of course
B sends email on his phone. Who can afford to not have email on their phone
and be connected all day long?
* A sends B a slack message "Hey @B". B gets a push notification because,
again, B is a hard worker and doesn't want to seem like he's *slacking*
(on Slack, ha ha, get it?) on his work communication duties. So B responds
immediately.

Why the current state of asynchronous communication is nonsense and actively
destructive:
* First, please acknowledge that most people's smartphone behavior would fit
the descriptions on the
[WebMD Drug Addiction](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/signs-of-drug-addiction#1) page. Just replace "drug" with "phone" and laugh miserably at
our / your plight. (Remember when WebMD was just as disreputable and jank and
memeable as Wikipedia was?)
* Second, realize that async communication is meant to *not* be in real-time.
That means that you can
> [take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when [you] get back. Asynchronous communication means [you] can ask [your] coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she’ll get back to me when she’s available](https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/)
* It means that you're in control of your time and that you have plenty of
opportunity to get into your productivity zone.
* Push notifications hijack your attention mechanism and often come from apps
that are engineered to be habit-forming, even addictive. For every second you
you take to context switch, you have to take multiples more seconds to recover
and get back to your original task. Facebook, IG, Twitter, Slack, etc, are
designed to get you to use them more because MAU, DAU, daily usage time, etc
are all "success" metrics for these companies. Stop letting them set up camp
in your mind.

How we all should be using async communication tools:
* [Calmly](https://basecamp.com/books/calm).
* Send thoughtful messages and understand that people will get to them when
they get to them. In the meantime, don't you have other things to work on?
* Turn off your notifications and be strict about not checking apps at all
hours of day. Maybe once before work, once during lunch, once after work. The
rest can wait.
* Use the tools properly and you will reap more out of them. You will also
be less in pain from improper use of your tools.
* If you need to talk to someone *right now*, take deep breaths and figure out
your real priorities.

How to prevent sync comms from encroaching on your time:

Big flipping pet peeve from async communication abusers:
* When people message me and expect an immediate response...
  * "Hey, Bianca, do you want anything from the grocery store? I'm there rn"
  * "Hey, Bianca, can you send me a picture of that thing on my desk? I need
  it for my meeting in 5 min"
  * "Hey, Bianca, we're having a meeting in 2 minutes. Can you join us?"
  * "Hey, Bianca, there is literally a party going on right now in your
  cubicle. Bring us some beer?"

Thanks for reading. Catch up with me over email, thank you.
