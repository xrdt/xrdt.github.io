title: "Can I Handle the Cold?"

This winter, I’ve been spending quite a bit of time in cold places. I went to Park City over the Thanksgiving weekend, went to Aspen last week, and am now in Mont Tremblant in Quebec. The snow-covered terrain is strikingly beautiful, and I much prefer it to the dry, brown plant coverage that would otherwise be showing on the mountains, but I tend to be woefully underdressed. What I think is warm, coming from Southern California, is simply not enough to fight sub 32 F temperatures.

I don’t think I’d be able to handle living in a place with cold winters. I say this because I think I would quickly tire of the hassle of needing to wear sufficient warm clothing when going outside. I think I would miss the dry asphalt of LA and the convenience of being able to drive around without thinking about how snow affects the road conditions. Yet, at the same time, I want to experience something new. I think it would be worth my while to live through an full-year cycle in a place has marked differences between the seasons. I want to test my mettle and use the location change to force a change in my behavior. I don’t think I necessarily want to make this change right after I graduate, but if it does end up that my first job puts me in such a place, I’ll be up for the challenge.

I once had a strong desire to chase the winter by switching between the Northern and Southern hemispheres as the seasons changed. I still think it would be fun to maintain a dual residence across the hemispheres, but I’m not sure I still want to chase winter. I suppose I’ll make that decision when the time comes.






一個人要走的路 慌張的無法前進
問東問西他人指教 浸濕主觀意見
自省走向陌路 腦海裡的空想到此沒用
世界真理只能由親自體驗來了解
踏出自己的生活實現自己的夢
未來還能變得多美妙
