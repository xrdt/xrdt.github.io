Being interesting requires you to have passion for what you do.<br>
Being interesting requires you to have empathy for others.<br>
Being interesting requires you to be able to read other people and have some sense for what will keep them engaged.<br>
Being interesting requires you to have unique thoughts.<br>
Being interesting requires you to be smart and able to think on your feet and make fast connections between the
current topic and adjacent topics. Being interesting requires you to either have lots of breadth and thus lots of
random things to contribute to the conversation or lots of depth and thus lots of additional detail you can provide to
specific topics or to be a T-shaped person.<br>
Being interesting requires you to care about the world, what you do in the world, the people in the world, and the
connections between people.<br>
Being interesting requires you to be in touch with what makes you human.<br>
