Why didn't you tell me earlier?<br>
Your sister tried but you kept saying you didn't hear her<br>
So now you crying bloody murder<br>
because you didn't get the job you'd work for<br>

That's why I keep saying you gotta use that brain of yours<br>
Opportunities don't just wash up on the shores<br>
They ain't as easy to pick up as whores<br>
How'd you end up cleaning your pores?<br>

I hope you learned from this incident<br>
Not to sit back and be so complacent<br>
You gotta prepare, show up, deliver, like your brother Trent<br>
You could learn a lot from him, we all rooting for your improvement<br>

What's that? You going on again, didn't tell me earlier?<br>
Speak louder, I can't hear when you murmur<br>
I don't have time for this, I'm going to eat a burger<br>

Quit following me around<br>
You like a sick puppy dog, desperate for love but belonging to the pound<br>
Get back to work, figure out how you're going to make your life sound<br>
Don't be whining, I'm paying for you to turn your life around<br>

I didn't tell you earlier? Please<br>
Have you ever thought that your brain used to be made of peas?<br>
That you used to say the world is flat, the flu is a flea's disease?<br>
You've come a long way, but don't stop. One day you'll be as rich as Jay Z<br>

The phone is ringing, go pick it up<br>
What? Aunt Marge's reading tea leaves in her cup?<br>
Cousin Bobby's outside trying to do a pull up?<br>
You don't look to well, are you going to throw up?<br>

What's gotten into you, you're acting like a nervous wreck<br>
Didn't you tell me you took care of that bounced check?<br>
Now you saying debt collectors after you what the heck?<br>
Why didn't you tell me earlier, now the yoke's on my neck<br>
