I've been feeling very ... low energy recently. It's not unnatural for me to
cycle through periods of relative happiness and depression, but I'm fed up
with having to deal with this weakness, especially that I no longer have the
massive burden of school weighing on my shoulders (I really did not enjoy
middle school - college, but I also know that I didn't take the higher levels
seriously enough). In order to relieve myself of some of this mental blockage,
I thought I'd talk a bit about what's been bothering me of late. Most of the
post is utter drivel, so please feel free to completely discard this post and
move on with your life.

* I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping fewer than 10 hours recently.
Before this month, I had no issue getting up around 7:30am. Some days I would
wake even earlier, at 5:30 - 6am. No doubt this inability to wake up early
is correlated to my mood.
  * I would like my sleep schedule to move back to where I am waking up at 5am.
  I've always had problems working with a schedule like that because I find it
  insanely difficult to be awake when it is still dark outside. I desperately
  need to invest in better lighting so I can feel warm and fuzzy when my body
  forces my eyelids open in the wee hours of the morning.
* I'm not sure of my career ambitions.
  * I think my uncertainty here is more to do with my laziness and naivete
  than it is to do with anything more serious.
* Trust but verify means you don't trust... It's a Russian proverb that Reagan
made popular. It bothers me when people use this because you may as well be
more direct and just check my work. You don't need to imply a false sense of
faith in my ability.
* I realized just this week that I don't think I would ever like to live in LA
again.
  * I think SF Bay Area beats LA in terms of nature. I don't really like
  looking at LA, honestly...
  * LA beats SF Bay Area in terms of food, but I'm slowly forcing myself to
  get used to not eating out as frequently as I did when growing up and in
  college, so the lack of good options here should steadily bother me less
  with time.
  * SF Bay Area beats LA in terms of job opportunities for techies.
  * Both are equally tied when it comes to congestion.
  * LA beats SF Bay Area on cost of living.
  * With the exception of flying planes, I'm finding the Bay Area to be more
  accessible for hobbies like paragliding. I think both are equally accessible
  when it comes to racing cars or ATVing (Monterey and Sonoma or SLO up north).
  I can only think of Willow Springs down south.
  * LA beats SF Bay Area in artistic culture (Venice Beach, LACMA, MoMA, Arts
  District).
  * I don't think I ever felt like there was much to do in LA. I certainly
  don't think I felt like there were was serious entrepreneurial activity
  going on in LA, at least not in the same form as it is happening in SF. But
  there are noticeable culture differences between LA and SF startups that
  should certainly be considered.
* I am a huge fan of driving in the rain and in the dark, especially on mostly
empty highways (I-280 most of the times). A recent obsession of mine has been
to speed along Page Mill / Moody Roads in Los Alto Hills in the dark.
* I really don't understand the obsession with Japanese food. I've been to
Japan maybe four times at this point. Each time, I have been severely
disappointed with the food. Pretty much the only Japanese foods I enjoy eating
are curry, tonkotsu ramen, unagi don, and sushi. Sukiyaki / shabu shabu / all
the other 50 kinds of hot pot Japan supports are far inferior to Mongolian
hot pot. Japanese bread is ok, but I think Taiwan took it to the next level.
Oden? Taiwan does it better. Tamago? I don't like how sweet it is. ~~I've
had just as good if not better ramen in the US (for the same price..).
Tempura? Ok, I must admit do like eating fried foods...Okonomiyaki? Ok,
fine, I do like that. Yakitori? Eh...never liked it or any of its sister
skewers. Onigiri? Eh, it can taste ok, but it's pretty nutritionally lacking.
Udon? Mmm...the only time I've accepted udon is when it's been drenched in
sauce as rich as the ones I've gotten from
[Marugame](https://marugameudon.com). Soba? Ok, soba is fun but I don't really
consider it nutritionally effective. Matcha? I hopped off that bandwagon about
two years ago. Gyudon? Ehh... the beef has never been that good. Gyoza? Din
Tai Fung (in Taiwan, the US chain doesn't count) is the pinnacle for me.~~
  * Ok, enough complaining about Japanese food...
* I am bothered by the fact that I can't get into cheese like all the other
LCHF dieters. Granted, I don't know my cheeses very well, but I've tried
cycling through Brie, plain goat cheese, cheddars (including Moon Cheese,
which I'm not going to rave about), and Mozzarella. People on the Internet
have said good things about Kerrygold Dubliner, so I may buy a small chunk and
see how it goes. It probably won't change my general lack of enthusiasm for
cheese.
  * I am also very uninterested in nut butters. I hate how sticky they are. I
  also just don't see how anyone in their right mind thinks they taste good.
  The only situation where I've accepted nut butters is as the base for
  peanut sauce.
* I recently moved my "bed" to the ground. I'd been sleeping on the ground,
on some yoga mats, for about a month now. I finally decided to fully commit to
sleeping on the ground and disassemble my bed frame. Now I feel like I have
*so* much more space in my room. I breathed such a sigh of relief once I
completed that task on Saturday.
