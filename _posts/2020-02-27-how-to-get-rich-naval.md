__Wealth vs. Money vs. Status__:<br>
__Wealth__ -- Assets that earn while you sleep. This is what you really want, because it is what secures you
your freedom, your agency, your sovereignty. Wealth creation is a positive-sum activity.<br>
__Money__ -- How we transfer wealth. It is a way to keep track of credits and debits on other people's time. Ref [this
film where time is literally money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Time). Naval: "Money will solve all your
money problems." Some people play the anti-money game, saying they don't want to have money, that it's unvirtuous
to have or want money and they are playing the status game.<br>
__Status__ -- Ranking in the social hierarchy. Necessary evil (not sure why it's necessary, but the phrase
works as a rhetorical device). It's a zero-sum game that's been played since the monkey ages.

Status used to be a better predictor of survival than wealth because hunter gatherers didn't have a way to store
social credits. You were either friends with everyone in your tribe (especially the tribe leader) or you were forced
to fend on your own when bears or famine or disease or those nasty European colonists came along. Agrarians
kick-started the wealth-based society because they settled down and could actually store substantial amounts of stuff.

There is always a conflict between wealth and status. Just look at journalists attacking rich people and [populist
movements](https://www.bridgewater.com/resources/bwam032217.pdf).

*Naval*: "You should avoid status games because they make you an angry, combative person. You're always fighting to put
other people down, and to put yourself and the people you like up."

*Naval*: "Most of the time when you're trying to create wealth, you're going to be attacked by someone who is trying to up
their status." Again, status as a necessary evil.

*Naval*: "Most of the wealth we are looking at today has been created. The idea that wealth is stolen largely comes from
people who are playing status games."

__Everyone can be Rich and Live in Abundance__:<br>
Naval talks about how *everyone* can be rich (what he really means is wealthy and free, but rich is a
more attractive word). He makes the statement that he'd rather be a poor person today than an aristocrat in Louis
the XIV's France. I don't think I can agree with the idea that the subjective experience of the modern, 20th-21st
century human is superior. I think it's hard to argue that the average / median / whatever nice statistical
measure that actually means something you want to apply happiness of humans has meaningfully changed over the
centuries. Being poor sucks no matter what century you are in. Being rich comes with its comforts, but it also
comes with [boredom](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1220750799636033542). These are truths that I believe
have held the test of time. Flushable toilets and sliced bread can't change human psychology and how we
perceive things. But perhaps I've delved too far into this tangent. I am a big fan of Naval's framing of wealth as a
tool for securing [freedom, which I've termed agency, but you get the
point](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1186124029226172416). I don't agree with the statement on improved quality
of life because I'm thinking in terms of perception and experience and emotions, not in terms of material value...
ahem that's a another tangent I'll save for [another post](../25/modern-life-is-not-better.html).

Naval talks about what would happen if everybody in the world was trained as a software or hardware person. His endgame is that
we would no longer need to work because the advances in technology would do everything. *Naval*: "We would be living in
*massive* abundance." Those who still work work as creative expression of themselves.

__Capitalism__:<br>
*Naval*: "Capitalism is *intrinsic* to the human species."  The idea of exchange is built into humans. *Naval*: "We are
the only animals that cooperate across genetic boundaries." We can cooperate because we can keep track of debits and credits.
Becoming wealthy is "merely a matter of education and desire."

Watch out for capitalism getting hijacked by: improper pricing of externalities (environment), corruption, monopolies.

When the \# Takers > \# Makers --> society falls apart. This is why Communist countries like Venezuela fall apart.
Naval makes an analogy to the body getting taken over by parasites. Parasites are the things that can hijack capitalism.
"If a society does not respect the (ethical, meaning free minds and free markets, small-scale exchange between humans
that is voluntary and does not have outsized impact on others) wealth creation process, it will plunge into *ruin and darkness*".

__Getting Lucky__:<br>
Becoming wealthy is about becoming the *kind* of person who makes money. Wealth creation is a skill. Given 1000 parallel
universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. Requisite means for wealth creation: functioning mind and body.

[4 types of luck](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html):
* Blind luck (dumb luck) -- Something completely random happened (fortune, fate, etc).
* Hustle (Fortune favors the bold) -- Generating opportunities by stirring the pot and increasing the likelihood of successful
random pairings emerging.
* Scout, or being good at spotting luck (chance favors the prepared mind)
* Unique brand, unique character, unique mindset -- example here is that you are the world's best at deep sea treasure diving. If
some rich person happens to find out about a deep sea sunken ship and needs someone to go explore it for him, you get "lucky" and can
share in his discovery.

Naval speaking about his experience building wealthy: Becoming wealthy has been the result of a consistent, steady
struggle of creating businesses and investments.

Naval: I, in fact, have *too many* ways to make money. I don't have enough
[time](https://twitter.com/xdrtxrdt/status/1220750799636033542). There's just so many ways to make wealth,
to create opportunities, and, as a byproduct, get paid by society, that I just can't handle it all. The
Internet has opened up so many new ways to become wealthy.

Nivi: There is no common cliche for the 4th kind of luck. (I've put the cliches in parenthesis above.)<br>
Naval: by the time you get to the 4th type of luck, it becomes so deterministic that it's no longer luck.

Naval: You want the kind of reputation that makes people do deals *through* you. You can be the best
at what you do. You can be the trustworthy middleman (think what you could get if you had Warren Buffett's
reputation). One issue is that reputation is a fragile form of leverage.

The 4th kind of luck can be generated through eccentricity and being fanatically interested in something.
You can read more about this idea in Paul Graham's post on [bus ticket collecting](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html).

"Extreme people get extreme results." -- Sam Altman<br>
Naval denouncing people playing status games on Twitter: "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."

__Getting Rich Strategy__:<br>
You're not going to get rich renting out your time. Ownership is the best way to leverage your inputs. Of course, there
are [exceptions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21910734). Even doctors who get rich do so through ownership, through
investment and business. Being an employee means you will always be paid the bare minimum because you are not taking the risk;
you're not in charge. You're getting paid the bare minimum to incentivize you to do the job. It also means that you're
probably replaceable. Your role is probably set; your job skills are probably taught in school, which means you could be replaced
by fresh young grads or automated away; *worst of all*, you're probably not doing anything creative.

The real moneymaker is to find something where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected, or leveraged. Software is the
latest lever by which nerds in their underwear in college dorms are eating the world. Intellectual property is a form of leverage.
Scale is a form of leverage. Authenticity and creativity are leverage.

Do not upgrade your lifestyle too quickly. Living far below your means is a way of achieving freedom. Upgrade in a
punctuated equilibrium. Upgrade once you make a significant jump in your means. This way you have buffer during the long,
intermediate periods where you are building up your personal moat.

<font size="10">The golden rule for getting rich : Deliver to the world what it wants (but doesn't yet know how to get at scale).</font>

Technology -- things that don't quite work yet. Everything you see around you was technology once: roads, petroleum, cars, iPhones.
Someone figured out how to refine and mass produce those products. Society rewarded them with extreme wealth.

__Creativity, Authenticity, Finding Your Audience__:<br>
The Internet's superpower is shrinking the world (borrowed from [McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media)).
You can find your audience for practically anything. Everybody can be creatively superb at their own thing because the Internet
has given them a way to connect with people who will reward them for their unique talents.

Escape competition through authenticity.

__Long Term Games__:<br>
You want to play long term games with long term people because it's the only way to escape game theoretic nastiness like
the Prisoner's Dilemma. [Tit for tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation) has also been shown to
be the superior strategy in repeated games. Another reason to play nice with others: all the goodness in life comes from
compound interest. Get Rich Quick schemes still don't exist and aren't likely to exist during your career. What wealth you
build will be built over a long process filled with potholes that you need other people to help you get over. You also aren't
likely to be given the big rewards in the middle of the process, so you want to make sure that you form long-term relationships
with the people who are going to build wealth with you.

Trust is leverage. Think of your partnership as a snowball rolling down the hill. Every project you complete together sets you up to
accomplish even greater, even bigger, even more wealth creating things in the future. It's the power of compound interest, of
nonlinear growth.

Long term games tend to end up being positive sum. Everyone gets rich together.<br>
Short term games tend to end up zero-sum game. Everybody can see the last move so they backwards induct and end up trying to undercut
one other.<br>
Socialists don't play either game and show up at the end when all the riches have been gained and take a couple of slices out of the pie.

__What to Look for in People__:<br>
High intelligence, high energy, high integrity.
* High intelligence -- increases your chances of going down the right path and being able to solve problems that appear
* High energy -- It's a long road ahead and it's no simple task to stay motivated the whole way through, especially if you have
subordinates and investors and other stakeholders to keep motivated.
* High integrity -- You don't want to get screwed. Remember that everything good comes through compound interest and that trust is
a major lever in human interactions.

Note that you can't convince people to have high energy for your project. You can inspire them in the short run but you can't [fundamentally
change whether they believe that the problem you're proposing is worth working on for the next 5 years
minimum](../13/life-update-feb-2020.html). They have to come to that conclusion on their own and
demonstrate, through signaling, that they care enough to commit to a long-term journey with you.

Signals are what you do despite what you say. It's what you do when nobody's watching.

People are oddly consistent.

[Delegate to people who are actually good at the things you want them to do](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity).
Simple point...but how often is it followed?

Look for people who are irrationally ethical. Integrity is perhaps the most important thing to look for in a partner (almost put long-term partner but
what's a partner if they're not long-term??). Self esteem is a reputation you have with yourself. You'll always know.
心裡有數. [Warren Buffett's Inner Scorecard](https://fs.blog/2016/08/the-inner-scorecard/).

__On Optimism__:<br>
Cynics and pessimists hold self-fulfilling beliefs. Basically they've given up on the world and also want you to give up. Why? If you fail,
they're right. If you're right, you make them look bad. You want to be a rational optimist and you want to *surround yourself* with rational
optimists because those are the people who will tend to have a strong action bias. Naval: "All the successful people I know have a strong action bias."
Not to imply the reverse statement, but being action oriented is a great way to learn. Nivi: eventually you'll run out of unluck.

We are probably descended from pessimists. Naval: If you and a friend are in the savannah and see a lion, probably the pessimist who thinks "we're dead"
and runs is going to survive. The optimist who says "he's probably not going to attack" gracefully exited the gene pool. Luckily for us, modern society
has flipped the circumstances. We are now more likely to operate in places where the downside is limited (esp. financially) and the upside is unlimited. It
thus makes sense to take risks and be bold and start something crazy.

__On Becoming A Really Standout Person (Will be Continued in Next Post)__:<br>
If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. The way to get paid at scale is to have:
specific knowledge , accountability, leverage, judgement.
* Accountability -- why *you* should get paid.
* Leverage -- Scale, decoupling inputs from outputs. Only way to make big things happen.
* Judgement -- Nivi added this. You should know what to do when, why, how.
* Specific knowledge -- This is the real big hitter in this list. It's the reason you're getting paid and you're not going to be
automated away or replaced by fresh people. It's the result of you pursuing your innate talents and building a knowledge / skill / reputation
base that cannot be replicated and is very difficult to penetrate. It's the result of you being authentic, being unique, and exploring the frontier
of technology and creativity. One great way that specific knowledge *used* to be taught is through apprenticeships. There's certain things that just
can never be taught. But everything can be learned. There are some barriers to learning. For example, learning soft skills as an adult is really
hard. You may have insufficient interest in something to really learn and master it. So on and so forth, but none of these things invalidate just
how valuable apprenticeship knowledge is. It's so valuable that when Buffett offered to work for Benjamin Graham (not Paul) for free, Graham said
Buffett was overpaid. Graham's knowledge was *so valuable* that he wanted Buffett to *pay him* for the time.
  * If you don't have specific knowledge, your wealth devolves into your cost of training + ROI on that training.
  * A great example of someone with massive specific knowledge is [Scott Adams](https://twitter.com/scottadamssays?lang=en). He's built huge credibility
  through his [analytical blog posts](https://www.scottadamssays.com), scaled up his audience through Periscope, created a moat through his combo
  of drawing and writing and marketing and business etc., learned hypnosis, so on. You want to be Scott Adams.
