Customer centric view. I'm not convinced SaaS or software subscription services
like Spotify work out better for consumers, at least financially.

SaaS Superior (b/c it's like the mainframe / client model of computing?):
* Continuous updates
* Less infrastructure management
* Access anywhere (b/c SaaS is on cloud)
* "low" monthly cost is psychologically preferable.

One Time License Software Superior:
* Customer ownership of product and data is clear. No need to worry about
supporting company going out of business or no longer offering the software.
* Customer controls software version.
* Likely cheaper on a lifetime cost basis.
* ?? Better guarantees on software stability due to infrequent release.
