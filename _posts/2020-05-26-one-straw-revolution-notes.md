Masanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese farmer famous for advocating "natural farming",
or "do-nothing farming".

His motivating philosophy:
> Humanity knows nothing at all. There is no intrinsic value in anything, and
every action is a futile, meaningless effort.

The principles of natural farming are:
  1. No cultivation. No plowing or turning of the soil.
  2. No chemical fertilizer or prepared compost. Fukuoka uses a ground cover
  of clover or vetch of alfalfa, threshed straw, and chicken manure when
  available.
  3. No weeding or tillage or herbicides.
  4. No dependence on chemicals.
* Fukuoka claims that his methods require far less effort than modern
techniques do, achieve equivalent or greater yields than the best plots of
land in Japan, and are naturally self-sustaining because the practices are in
alignment with nature. Modern farmers spend so much time tilling and planting
seeds in a straight line and fighting off the never-ending barrage of pests
and pruning and running ever faster to keep at bay the inevitable symptoms
of deviating from nature. Farmers used to compose haiku and have three months
of winter leisure. Sure, the farmers may have been poor, but they were always
able to have something to eat or get by.
* Fukuoka also talks about diet and the natural way to eat and going back to
the "ancestral" Japanese diet of miso and soy sauce and seasonal vegetables
and grains like barlye or rice. Another book I'm reading on Ben's
recommendation, [100 Million Years of Food](https://www.amazon.com/100-Million-Years-Food-Ancestors/dp/1250050413), advocates a similar "go back to the basics" kind of eating.
* Just because he calls his method the "do-nothing" method doesn't mean it's
easy. You still have to get up early each morning to chop wood and carry water
and scatter seeds and monitor and in general take care of the farm.
* I found some of his later ramblings on philosophy and losing the
discriminating mind and surrendering to the purposeless (but not meaningless)
ways of nature annoying. I was a fan of Alan Watts
["The Wisdom of Insecurity"](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Alan-W-Watts-ebook/dp/B005YNPBH0/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+wisdom+of+insecurity&qid=1590477831&sr=8-1),
so I am sympathetic to Fukuoka's admonitions against materialism and giving
into the fragile, self-interested capitalism that drove the agricultural
equipment manufacturer to reject his idea for a simple machine because it
would prevent farmers from buying their next bigger and better and faster and
more gas-guzzling $1000s tractor. The problem was that he started to repeat
himself. Perhaps he got carried away with his frustration for the ills of the
modern world.
* Some of the criticisms against his techniques (taken from Wikipedia) are that
they are more sophisticated than they seem and that the adaptation period
can require multiple years of crop failure, rather than the 10% reduction in
crop yield Fukuoka predicted. Some even say that his methods are not compatible
with modern agricultural production.
  * I would respond that there is great subtlety hidden within every masterful
  technique. I have not personally studied the yields or nutritional value of
  Fukuoka's crops, but if he is as good as he claims at working with nature,
  which is a system that is complex beyond belief (despite our attempts to
  dissect and categorize and study the world one grain of sand or bacterium
  or atom at a time), I would expect there to be great amount of detail and
  implicit knowledge that he did not write or could not write into this simple,
  philosophical, one could say propagandic tome.
  * Fukuoka certainly should take the blame for being way off in his estimates
  for the losses during the adaptation period, but I don't think the years of
  adaptation practitioners experience is at all contradicting what Fukuoka has
  repeatedly said about modern agricultural practices draining the nutrition and
  health out of the soils. It takes time to rebuild a beautiful topsoil layer
  with worms and the right balance of nitrogen and potassium and predators and
  insects. If nature operates on the scale of years, so be it. Nature has
  existed far longer than humans have and humans have existed in balance with her
  for far longer than we have tried to dominate her with repeated applications
  of ever stronger technology. Fukuoka's is the long horizon play.
  * The comment that his methods are not compatible with modern agricultural
  productions sounds like a farce. Isn't that the whole point? He deviates
  from modern worship of combines and tractors and gas-guzzlers and pesticides
  and slavery of the farmer to government subsidies and the foreign-imported
  desires for resource expensive beef and non-Japanese wheat and out of season
  but profitable melons. But what does that matter? His philosophy is in line
  with that of all those who would advocate we return to a simpler way of
  living. If that sounds out of the place with the "growth at all costs" and
  "money money money" ways of capitalism, I think you've got the right read
  on him.
* Here are some quotes:
  > Doctors and medicine become necessary when people create a sickly
  environment. Formal schooling has no intrinsic value, but becomes necessary
  when humanity creates a condition in which one must become 'educated' to get
  along. [...] To the extent that trees deviate from their natural form, pruning
  and insect extermination become necessary; to the extent that human society
  separates itself from a life close to nature, schooling becomes necessary. In
  nature, formal schooling has no function.
  > Human beings with their tampering do something wrong, leave the damage
  unrepaired, and when the adverse results accumulate, work with all their might
  to correct them. When the corrective actions appear to be successful, they
  come to view these measures as splendid accomplishments. People do this over
  and over again. It is as if a fool were to stomp on and break the tiles of his
  roof. Then when it starts to rain and the ceiling begins to rot away, he
  hastily climbs up to mend the damage, rejoicing in the end that he has
  accomplished a miraculous solution.

  > It is the same with the scientist. He pores over books night and day,
  straining his eyes and becoming nearsighted, and if you wonder what on earth
  he has been working on all that timeâ€”it is to become the inventor of
  eyeglasses to correct nearsightedness.

  > Next I went to a manufacturer of agricultural equipment. I was told here
  that such a simple machine, no matter how much you tried to make of it, could
  not be sold for more than $3.50 apiece. "If we made a gadget like that, the
  farmers might start thinking they didn't need the tractors we sell for
  thousands of dollars." He said that nowadays the idea is to invent rice
  planting machines quickly, sell them head over heels for as long as possible,
  then introduce something newer. Instead of small tractors, they wanted to
  change over to larger-sized models, and my device was, to them, a step
  backward. To meet the demands of the times, resources are poured into
  furthering useless research, and to this day my patent remains on the shelf.
  > If we do have a food crisis it will not be caused by the insufficiency of
  nature's productive power, but by the extravagance of human desire.
  > The act of defense is already an attack.
  > In the end, to become one with nature, to live with God, one cannot help
  others or even receive help from them.

  > "Among children there is always one without a care in the world who laughs
  happily as he pees, there is another who always ends up the 'horse' when
  playing 'horse and rider,' and always a third who is clever at tricking the
  others out of their afternoon snack. Before the head of the class is chosen,
  the teacher talks seriously about the desirable qualities of a good leader and
  the importance of making a wise decision. When the election is held, it is the
  youngster who laughs happily by the side of the road who is chosen."

  > Everyone was amused, but I could not understand why they were laughing. I
  thought it was only natural.

  > If things are seen in terms of gain and loss, one must regard as the loser the
  child who always ends up playing the role of the horse, but greatness and
  mediocrity do not apply to children. The teacher thought the clever child was
  the most remarkable, but the other children saw him as being clever in the
  wrong way, someone who would oppress others.

  > To my readers,
  >
  > There is nowhere better than this world. Years ago I realized that we human
  beings are good just as we are and I set out to enjoy my life. I took a
  carefree road back to nature, free from human knowledge and effort. Since
  then fifty years of my life have flown away. I have had some successes, but
  also failures. Many of my youthful dreams remain unfulfilled. I know my time
  here on earth is limited.

  > I am retired now and live in a mountain hut in the orchard. I have closed my
  farm to the public so that I can better cherish the time left to me. The best
  part of living a retired life on the mountain, isolated from news of the
  outside world, is that I have a different sense of time. I hope, as the days
  go by, that I will be able to experience a day as a year. Then, like the
  tribal people I met in Somalia, I will not know how old I am.

  > These days I try to imagine that I am one hundred years old...or even two
  hundred. I hope that when I pass away my mind and body will still be in good
  condition. When I go to the fields or the orchard I say to myself: make no
  promises, forget about yesterday, do not think about tomorrow, put sincere
  effort into each day's work and leave no footprints here on earth. I am happy
  simply to work joyfully on my farm, which to me is the Garden of Eden. The way
  of natural farming is forever uncompleted. Nature can never be understood or
  improved upon by human effort. In the end, to become one with nature, to live
  with God, one cannot help others or even receive help from them. We can only
  walk our paths alone.
