I had been waiting for my student pilot for about four months at this point.
I'd completed the IACRA registration on Dec 15, 2018. With a 120 day valid
period, I had until April 15, 2019 to get my plastic card. Well, the months
passed by. There were some issues with the system so my record wasn't
processed until Feb 23, 2019. As much as people like to complain about
government slowness, surely it doesn't take over a month to mail a piece of
plastic to a person. I called the airmen registry on 4/4/19. I checked my mail
on 4/15 and voila!, there it was, my beautiful, shiny student pilot
certificate.

So what's this dream thing about? 3 - 5 days before I went to pick my
certificate, I had an emotional dream where I had gotten my certificate out of
the mail. I remember peeling my card off the paper it was attached to. I
decided to ignore that dream and not check my mailbox for a couple of days,
figuring that the dream was entirely a hoax. You see how that turned out.
