[HackerNews thread on having children](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22913871)
"Having kids basically means you've copped out in terms of about 13 years of your
contributions to society."

Since attention is a zero sum game, some parents mistakenly believe they should
throw all their energies into coddling their children.

Being a good role model for your children. The objective is to raise your
children to contribute in unique and interesting and fulfilling ways. It's a lot
easier for them to do to that if you're also doing that.

Compassion for having your children avoid the hardships that you had to suffer
through may be a misguided intention.

But what does society lose when some hard things are not carried down, generation
by generation, like they always have? Street Food is the example that looms in
my mind.

The house a child grows up in is his parents' choice. I sometimes look at pictures
of houses and wonder what the experience of being a child there would be like.
Fancy granite and glass and white carpets.

Insufficiently large developmental gap leading to parents
