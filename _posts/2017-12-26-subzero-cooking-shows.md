Tomorrow will be my first day outside in subzero temperatures (Fahrenheit). Mont Tremblant is getting a strong blast of Arctic winds, pushing temperatures down to -13 F for tomorrow. I’ll be heading up into the mountain for some snowboarding tomorrow afternoon, so hopefully my toes and fingers will stay intact.

I just watched the last couple of episodes of the Food Network’s Holiday Baking Championship. The final contestants were all extremely talented and whipped up some remarkable desserts for the judges. The creativity and competence of the cooks is at level I have yet to achieve in any of my pursuits. They had such intuition about how to tackle each challenge they were presented with and how to negotiate all the surprises they were asked to incorporate halfway through their cooking time. It would be great to have that kind of expertise at some point in my life, but I hesitate about achieving it because I don’t know what I would want to get good at. I have a preference for being marginally good at everything. I want to be at least good enough to recognize my mistakes so I can practice and progress if I want to.
