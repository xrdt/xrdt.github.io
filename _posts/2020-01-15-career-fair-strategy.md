Today is marks the 4th career fair I've been to for the 2019 - 2020 hiring season: Stanford Computer Forum Winter Career Fair. I went with two of our
new recruiters (the recruiters that were originally around when I started with ThoughtSpot have since left) and two Stanford alumni. This career fair
was the exact same format as the Fall Computer Forum fair but had about 60% of the attendees and 90% of the companies. We were between Jane Street and
Schlumberger and across from Nvidia, so luckily we did not have any lines from other booths encroach upon our space and ability to snag interested
candidates. After I made updates to my post on [ThoughtSpot engineering](../../../2019/11/23/thoughtspot-engineering.html), I decided to try to ask
candidates to identify what problems they saw in the BI industry as an opening question. This question eventually morphed into what I think is a more
pointed and easier to answer question: "What do you think is blocking organizations from making more data-driven decisions?" I think this question is
highly relevant to ThoughtSpot because it's practically embedded in our mission: "ThoughtSpot exists to create a more fact-driven world through simple,
yet easy to use technology." If the world was already fact-driven, we wouldn't need to create simple, yet easy to use (does that phrasing make sense...
simple should be easy to use...) technology. I mixed in asking this question with doing a standard let me look at your resume and gently probe your
experience and then tell you about the company and then ask you to apply online and sign in on an iPad. I didn't find my question particularly effective
in drawing people's interest or in filtering for interesting candidates.

Why did my answer perform so poorly? One reason is that I think the answer I give for my question is too long. I give three blockers: data (quality and
access), skillset mismatch (lots of people want answers from their data, not a lot of people can make that happen), and speed (tools are slow or have
shallow learning curves). By the time I got to the third, people were already wanting me to shut up. Sometimes people would even interrupt after the
second point, leaving me with no real way to explain how we achieved the third. Note that I always started with "data" as the first blocker, even though
ThoughtSpot pretty much doesn't deal with data quality or access issues. I think that's sufficient reason to not bring in data. It's distracting. I
switch up the order of speed and skillset, and I'm not sure I have a real answer as to which is better to use first. Honestly, after today's disappointing
run with micro variations on this question, I'm not sure it is useful as a career fair question.

Another new tactic I tried today was to show candidates a live demo of the system. I pulled up a testing cluster on my laptop and typed in a couple of
queries to illustrate some of the teams' hard work. It struck a chord with some candidates, but I'm not sure it actually made a difference in helping me
assess the quality of a candidate.

I think my primary difficulty in career fairs is not knowing what the purpose of my interaction with these folks is. Am I trying to convince them or are
they trying to convince me? We say it's a bit of both, as though we should equally weight marketing and candidate evaluation, but I think companies at career
fairs should do 80% marketing and 20% low resolution filtering of candidates.

I don't think marketing your company is a trivial task. Do you approach marketing from the business motivation or do you jump directly into the why the
problem is technically cool or do you interweave both into a smooth narrative or do you point to past achievements like funding amounts raised or do you point to
perks and culture? I am biased towards using the business motivation approach, but I'm not sure whether every engineer needs to be product motivated to exactly
that extent. Perhaps the appropriate tactic here is to follow in the footsteps of great salespeople and slowly probe to figure out what will make this engineer
happy to show up to work each day. That requires stopping often and giving the candidate lots of opportunities to ask more questions and guide the conversation
(does that technique mean you will negatively view quiet or shy engineers who are otherwise brilliant??? Apply empathy is the best answer I have to that conundrum).

What exactly that filter should do is also not clear to me. Are we trying to filter
out people with insufficient experience? Are we trying to filter out people with insufficient interest in the company? (Am I missing another category of filtering?)
I think both filters are fine, but they raise the question of "how"? How do you know a candidate has insufficient experience? How do you know a candidate has insufficient
interest in the company? Are you trying to hire long-term players that you can train and groom or are you ok with hiring employees who will pump and dump your company
(frankly, that's what tech employees do these days anyway...they don't realize it takes about 2 -3 yrs to gain enough institutional knowledge to actually do a meaningful
project at that company). Do you know what you are hiring for or will that decision be made by someone higher than you and someone many months in the future (this is a
serious flaw of university career fair hiring. Students will be interviewed now for positions they will not fill for a minimum of 5 months later. By that point, the
company structure and its direction will have changed. It's also not clear how often the reps at a booth are hiring managers or just generic engineers with enough free
time to chat with students about their work.)? Do you actually do something meaningful with resumes you collect at career fairs or do you just toss them in recycling
because candidates need to apply online anyway? Do you have a way to follow up with people you meet at career fairs to encourage them to apply? Do you know what a good
engineer looks like on paper?

That last question, of what good engineers look like on paper, really bothers me, because I don't know how to sniff out good from mediocre or bad on paper. Every engineer
I meet, even if they seem to have passion for the industry and give good details on their previous engineering work, can at most be a YES from the career fair. They cannot be
marked as EXCELLENT until they prove that they get things done AND that they have technical chops AND that they are coachable (university career fairs are useful for
grabbing new grads, who...almost by definition NEED coaching and mentoring to become useful). So, no, having a 4.0 GPA (I couldn't care less about your GPA) and a bunch of
course projects (unless your course project is on a topic that you chose and is actually unique relative to what your peers also implemented for that project in that course,
I don't want to see it on your resume or hear about it) and conversation skills does not GUARANTEE you a job. Perhaps now some of what I actually am looking for in that
20% low-resolution filter is starting to crystallize: people who get things done, people who are coachable, people who engage with our problem, and people who exude a
drive for excellence (internal motivation). This I think is the key to hiring strong candidates who will provide continuing rewards to the team. How do you filter for each
characteristic?
* Getting things done is easy. Ask them to follow-up with you after the career fair. Give them your email and see if they at minimum say thanks for your time.
* Coachable. This requires some digging into their previous experiences to see how they went about getting their project done. What was their interaction with their mentor and
other stakeholders like?
* Engage with our problem. I was trying to filter for this with my initial question: "What do you think is blocking organizations from making more data-driven decisions?"
Whether or not a candidate engages with the problem can also be assessed by seeing if they engage with you when you show them a demo or describe the engineering stack of
the company. While some people may be ok with hiring candidates who just do their job right, I think it's better for long-term retention to hire someone who's at least
somewhat convinced your industry and solution are bringing sufficient value to society.
* Drive for excellence. This drive tends to manifest in the results. It's easiest to assess at the extreme fringes of excellence, but I think it's critical to look at your
experience and develop some kind of filter for bullshit projects. Perhaps Elon's question is best:
["What were the most difficult problems you faced and how did you solve them?"](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/why-spacex-ceo-elon-musk-asks-this-tricky-interview-question.html)

Whoo. I actually achieved my goal of ending this post with concrete and actionable criteria for evaluating people at career fairs. Any questions or comments?
