title: "How Do You Pay When You Try New Things, But Especially Food"

One day in my junior year of college, I took a trip with two other friends to
the beach. We stayed at the beach until about lunchtime, so we decided to drive
to somewhere in downtown LA for a meal. On the way to a restaurant one of the
friends chose, I said that if I choose the restaurant to eat at, and I like
the food there (as opposed to being some unknown choice off Yelp or another
list), my other friends shouldn't pay unless they like the food.

My other friends weren't super excited about this idea (probably because they
didn't want to take financial responsibility for many of  the meals they chose
the restaurant for :) ), but I thought it was the responsible way to eat. Now,
I'd use "skin in the game" to describe this trick.

I didn't mean to impose my idea upon my friends, but the friend who chose the
restaurant tried to implement it during our meal. Since I felt like she was
just being forced into it, I insisted I enjoyed the meal and we split the bill
evenly.

I have so far not implemented this policy. I think the only time this policy
comes into effect is during potlucks or dinners at someone's house. In that
case, guests either can be guaranteed to like what they bring and just eat that
or don't pay anyway for most of the dinner. But that's an unconscious
application of my proposal.

I'm a little surprised I didn't write this on the blog earlier...though I do
have a nice little note on the related [ideal
price](../../../2018/06/30/ideal-consulting-pay.html).
