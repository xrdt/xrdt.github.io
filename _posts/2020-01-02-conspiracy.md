A coworker recently brought up the "conspiracy" that even if a cure for cancer were developed, it wouldn't be
released because pharmaceutical companies would suppress the cure to guarantee their continued profits from
cancer drugs. Another coworker immediately responded by saying that such a scheme would be unlikely to happen
because it would require silencing too many independent researchers (whom would likely be responsible world citizens
and push for the release as aggressively as possible) and other non-self-interested entities. This other coworker
also said that free markets work to prevent such forms of collusion from happening. If I had more balls, I would have
laughed out loud and listed off just a couple of examples of modern collusion. I guess I have more balls on the internet
than in real life, so here's my (desperately incomplete and US focused) list:
* Big Tobacco: The Surgeon General published a report in [1964 linking smoking cigarettes (tobacco) to lung
cancer](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/first-surgeon-general-report-on-smokings-health-effects-marks-50-year-anniversary)
but it took 55 (!) years before the US passed a [federal
statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Smoking_Prevention_and_Tobacco_Control_Act) allowing the FDA to regulate the
tobacco industry. Joan Ifland lays it out with Ivor Cummins [here](https://thefatemperor.com/ep38-joan-ifland-the-textbook-on-processed-food-addiction/).
Of course, state laws were passed before the federal statue.
* [Big Sugar](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000729): Big Tobacco was the
[mastermind behind the modern addiction to sugar](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/health/big-tobacco-kool-aid-sugar-obesity.html).
It is claimed that [Big Sugar paid scientists to fabricate results in favor of high fat and high
cholesterol diets as causing heart disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/akjziz/til_in_the_1960s_the_sugar_industry_funded_and/),
but I haven't independently [verified that claim](https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/big-sugar-isnt-to-blame-for-steering-us-away-from-fat.html).
For a better answer on whether fat or sugar is bad, I recommend Ivor Cummin's many podcasts that state how it is the high-sugar high-fat diet
that kills, not a high-sugar low-fat or high-fat low-sugar diet.
  * [Gary Fettke](https://thefatemperor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Why-the-War-on-Meat-Find-out-here-from-Dr.-Gary-Belinda-Fettke-Podcast-16.pdf):
  He's just one victim of a massive campaign to silence those who reveal the truth about how loading sugars into our body is leading to terrible, terrible diseases like
  diabetes. He has some great points in the podcast about the 7th Day Adventists taking over modern nutrition and food companies.
* [Monsanto, Dupont, etc](https://science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/02.06.18%20-%20Spinning%20Science%20and%20Silencing%20Scientists_0.pdf):
Glysophate is only one [example](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/06/25/modified-a-film-about-gmos-and-the-corruption-of-the-food-supply-for-profit/)
* [Big Pharma](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3p2bvr/last_year_the_pharmaceutical_industry_spent_250/) and the
[FDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2vb6ns/constitutional_attorney_talks_about_fda/): The day
when [Big Pharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcEI_2-flro) stops lobbying will be a day the whole world shakes and
[crumbles](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/state-politics/pharma-lobbying-held-deep-influence-over-opioid-policies/).
* [Any](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)
[secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)
[government](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/family-jewels) [operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program):
Government operations aren't a perfect example due to the commitments to secrecy that government operatives agree to uphold
before assuming their responsibilities, but I think it's pretty clear that they show how people can be convinced to do
radical things and keep them hidden indefinitely.
* [Takeover](http://jacek.zlydach.pl/blog/2019-07-31-ads-as-cancer.html) of our attention by social media.
* [Danger of nuclear technologies](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1105105488197357569.html)
* The entire underworld and black market: drugs, prostitutes, sex slaves, child soldiers, illegal arms, organ harvesting, just about everything
you know is being traded but don't want to think about.
* [Madoff](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff) and other Ponzi schemes
* [Wikipedia list of proven conspiracies](http://web.archive.org/web/20190422213709/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proven_conspiracies)

There is absolutely no guarantee in the theory of free markets about entities acting for the greater good. I think the only thing a free market provides is the
freedom for entities to pursue and profit from their self-interest. It's business, after all.
