__Tech tools__:
* [Cheap 2 pack of Lapel Microphones](https://www.amazon.com/Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone-Bundle-Clip/dp/B082M9W4G1/ref=sr_1_7)
  * Have a 3.5mm jack so use with your phone or computer
* Super cheap [2 input 1 output HDMI Display Splitter](https://www.amazon.com/HDMI-Switch-4K-Splitter-Bi-Directional/dp/B079JQ9XXV/ref=sr_1_6)
  * Press a button to switch inputs
* [Neck phone holder / mount](https://www.amazon.com/Aduro-Holder-Gooseneck-Android-Smartphone/dp/B07DM7GZPJ/ref=sr_1_4)
  * Not sure how well these things work, but if you have the need for hands
    free video calling through your phone, on the couch, this might be what you
    want to buy.
* Orienting myself with the [Cassandra query-oriented NoSQL
  DataModel](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/data_modeling/index.html).
  * Column oriented database, you focus on designing tables to fulfill common
    query paths. Denormalized to allow for faster read performance, especially
    for cases where traditional RDBMS design would require that tons of tables
    need to be joined together.
  * Now the [HBase data model](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#datamodel),
    which is based on BigTable.
    > A Bigtable is a sparse, distributed, persistent multidimensional sorted
    > map.

__Tech Work__:
* [Project management is a mess](https://imgur.com/3O2kOG4)
* How [feature creeps to the point where you need 1k people instead of
  10](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24443807) to support an app
* Performance is nonencapsulable (sort of wrong...since you can do async, but
  it is a potential area of leakage that people who preach encapsulability
  might forget about.)
* [Performance +
  Security](https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/architecting-for-performance-and-security-at-the-same-time)
  through separation of concerns. Isolation is such powerful concept.
* [StackOverflow
  Architecture 2016 Edition](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/)
* [Rant against
  protobuffers](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html),
  from someone who loves the finer points of type theory
  * [Response from protobuf v2 and Cap'n Proto
   author](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21873418)
  * How do you interface between the serialized form and domain type
    efficiently?
* Julia Evans on being a [senior
  engineer](https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/)
  * Notice the ability / interest (passion, desire, want, internal motivation,
    curiosity) / value Venn Diagram appears in the boundaries section.

__Tech Knowledge__:
* [MESI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESI_protocol) for [cache
  coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)#WRITE-BACK)
* [API Design](https://pastebin.pl/view/cd9138da) from [Mike
  Ward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemward/), I assume.
  * Agree with pretty much all of his points.
* The day [YouTube got acquired](https://twitter.com/ramonvanmeer/status/1315094003931521025?s=20)
* What [Erlang / Elixir / BEAM](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21114796)
  is good at
  * Also, other people like [hacking in it](https://spawnfest.github.io)
* Stripe feels like a very nonconfrontational and maximally self reflective
  org.  Here's a post from them on making [Remote their 5th eng
  hub](https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub-one-year).
  * I really like the [questions](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture) they put in
    their jobs page.
* This is a [good
  thread](https://twitter.com/billclerico/status/1316220346442293249) on
  software underpricing. Suffice it to say that tech changes (improves) faster
  than human psychology is willing to acknowledge and then pay for.
* Why [patio11 joined
  Stripe](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2016/09/09/im-joining-stripe-to-work-on-atlas/)
  > my biggest impact — and the most personally fulfilling one — has been
  > helping others start and grow their own businesses.
  * Stripe is close to optimally crazy: "Stripe’s goal is to increase the GDP
    of the Internet"
  > It implies real people are going to make real businesses selling real
  > products and thereby experience real improvements in their real lives. I
  > know this works. I have seen it. I have lived it. I have watched it work
  > for hundreds of friends and acquaintances.
  * Atlas, which is what patio11 specifically works on, intervenes in the
    fragile, early days of new businesses. These internventions "may well
    increase the number of successful businesses surviving to major milestones
    like launch, profitability, bringing on employees, and sustained economic
    impact" --> economic growth
  * Also, this detail about [forcing others to pay attention to
   detail](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232420) is so smart I'm too
   dumb to have thought about it on my own.
  * [2 year
   reflection](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/)
    * Still working on increasing the GDP of the internet to the point where
    it becomes "visible in global macroeconomic indicators".
    * Why not work for yourself? Leverage VVV
    > Stripe offers a much larger platform to scalably educate and advise
    > entrepreneurs from, and unlike my own companies, it structurally benefits
    > directly from doing that.
    * [Raising people's
   ambitions](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html);
      always a good choice.
    * What happens when the org grows really really fast:
    > You have to constantly course correct your understanding of what is
    > material impact, because hopefully you’re searching for making material
    > impact, and things that were material three years ago might not move the
    > needle anymore. And things that were outlandishly impossible three years
    > ago might now be quite possible, and worth doing, but only if you can get
    > to them in the next six months.
    * I love thinking about organizational design and patio11 provides just
      enough fodder to get me ruminating for days:
    > BigCo doesn’t set out to be mediocre… BigCo just has an awful lot of
    > people with an awful lot on their plate, and many of them are
    > incentivized to make locally-optimal decisions at the expense of
    > competing global goals.
      * The solution:
      > a) hire small teams of very talented people who very intently care
      > about something and b) incentivize great work amongst numerous other
      > competing worthy priorities.
    * Also, sometimes things don't happen because there isn't sufficient
      tooling to surface a need for something to happen. I make a note below
      about how a key slice of the pie of our modes of interaction with the
      world is reactive.  As you gain more experience, your ability to project
      potential states of a system (esp. problems, because what could anybody
      be more interested in than in the cost of maintenance and repair *sigh*)
      into the future undeniably improves. But the limitations on projection
      will always exist. I suppose this is where skill in proofs and complex
      mathematical constructs that have fantastic guarantees on every X Y Z
      thing that matters can help future proof ideas and designs.
      * We build solutions to problems. Even exploration is a solution to the
        problem of uncertainty in our mental models.
  * [4 year reflection](https://kalzumeus.com/2020/10/09/four-years-at-stripe/#fnref:erb)

    * The irony:

    * What is your career plan:
    > my career success metric is making a large improvement in the lives of a

    * MLM, pyramid scheme, how far can it go ^ before it becomes illegitimate?

__Hiring__:
* [Sponsorship over
  mentorship](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/#sponsorship):
  > What members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is
  > opportunity and visibility, not advice.
  * Ok, I'm really shortchanging the parent article. It's a fantastic
    exposition of what it means to be a senior engineer and provides concrete
    stepping stones for you to think about your maturation as a leader.
* Big list of [interview questions](http://katemats.com/interview-questions/)
  * Also, that lady has clearly thought long and hard about how to be a good
   [eng leader](http://katemats.com/leadership/).
* What it takes (literally anecdotally) to become a [Staff + Eng](https://staffeng.com).
* [Human factors in
  engineering](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/08/07/human-factors-and-web-engineerings-intersection/)
  > the organic complexity of humans encourages a more experimental stance in
  > order to gain understanding, and system life cycle models need accordingly
  > to accommodate a greater degree of empiricism
  * ^^ Ah, pharma and medicine (which is all organic) relies heavily on the
    empirical.
* Eng ladder at [Mozilla](https://twitter.com/Gankra_/status/1046438955439271936)
  * I don't think I have a copy of TS's ladder saved...mistake.
* Prickly opinions but [I tend to agree with
  Naval](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) on
  [hiring](https://angel.co/blog/why-naval-ravikant-hires-artists)
* This is the first time I've seen someone say to [minimize false negatives
  rather than false positives](https://carta.com/blog/how-to-hire/) when
  hiring.
  * I have no issues with this suggestion and agree that most companies are far
    too reluctant and slow to fire. I really like the reverse framing that you
    can never get a false negative back into your company at the same cost.
    > Hiring is not a consequence of success. Revenue and customers are. Hiring
    > is a consequence of our failure to create enough leverage to grow on our
    > own.
  * It's not particularly surprising that Carta's CEO [draws inspiration from
   Netflix](https://carta.com/blog/carta-101/)
    * This post arouses some feelings of discomfort, mainly over the
      requirement to show up each day at 8:30am. I see that focing the team to
      show up at the same time forces stronger bonds between team members, but
      eh, I'm not a morning person and I'm highly introvered...Please don't
      pay undue attention to me.
    * I think the compensation nonsense is [actually
   nonsense](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/buridan.pdf). Why apply
   arbitrary cutoffs for salary. Just pay people the most and then let salary
   levels not be a concern. I do agree with automatic mark to market. Automate
   what you can.
    * I also don't think there's significant value to the
   [two](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898)
   [books](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1)
   that were recommended. They're more procedural and less principled, which
   makes them less intellectually pure than something like
   [this](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296).
* This post makes a similar argument to the one above, which is that [hiring is
a sign of failure](https://medium.com/@travismay/lessons-from-liveramp-842cf569f596).
  > it means that you didn’t automate sufficiently; teams should obsess with
  > leverage and how to make each person dramatically more effective.
  * The greatest example of how much leverage a small team can have is
   [WhatsApp](https://www.businessinsider.com/early-whatsapp-employeees-2014-2).
   The communication and coordination costs associated with having a larger
   team quickly overwhelm the gains from having more people. 500 people doesn't
   mean 10x more effective than 50 people. The ratio is probably closer to 2x,
   at best.
  * The other bullets are good but not nearly as mental model shattering as
    this one on hiring. I suppose I keep obsessing over the hiring question
   because, if you hire the [right
   people](https://angel.co/blog/why-naval-ravikant-hires-artists), and you
    give them the nutrients and space to build a good framework on which to
    build the actual product, things probably will just take care of
    themselves.
    * There's not often [much new
   thinking](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one) in
      this space. But I'm upset that I haven't managed to find or craete a
   [sufficient, pithy written
   description](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships) of what I think is
      just waht is needed in hiring. That's why I keep looking. That's why I
      keep banging on the same questions that I keep answering "I don't know"
      to. They feel like fundamental questions.

__Thinking Better__:
> [When experts are wrong](http://www.paulgraham.com/ecw.html), it's often
> because they're experts on an earlier version of the world.
* What are [Software People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReSlJ5cq5D0)
  * Believe: All problems can be solved with software.
  * This was highly motivational. I feel warm and fuzzy.
  * Minimal sensors and actuator (hardware) to maximize the surface area of
    problems that can be solved with software (power of software).
    * Compare Nokia with all the buttons to iPhone.
    * Compare traditional POS systems to Square + app.
    * Compare traditional car to Tesla.
    * Compare server racks to EC2.
  * Every great software company is redefining the customer experience at
    scale, for every single customer. Only software can do this.
  > The only source of competitive advantage is the one that can survive
    technology-fueled disruption: an obsession with customer experience.
  * Software people move fast.

__ML/AI__:
* Technical Judea Pearl book. [Causality: Models, Reasoning and
  Inference](https://www.amazon.com/Causality-Reasoning-Inference-Judea-Pearl/dp/052189560X)
  * [Nontechnical book by
   Pearl](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X)
    that's been gaining steam these days
* What is [Symbolic Processing](https://wiki.c2.com/?SymbolicProcessing)

__Things for the Backyard__:
* [Ropes course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXLqyNr2Sj0)!!
* Workout Shed (power cage, gym rings, med balls)
* Outdoor Fridge

__Things for the House__:
* Bookshelves in the hallways

__Internet Findings__:
* [19th century vision of Year
  2000](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/a-19th-century-vision-of-the-year-2000)
  * Automation is a big theme.
  * Flying is another fascination.
  * Also going underwater.
* [You change your mind when you have
  to](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19296696). Some people are more
  detail oriented and thus more likely to have better foresight. The rest of us
  have to acknowledge how much of our suggestions and perspectives are driven
  by past problems we've personally experienced. This means that the only way
  to build better is to experience more.
  * Also from that same parent thread:
  > "The bigger something is, the more structure it needs"
  * ^ that is, static typing helps a lot as a codebase grows. Static typing and
    compiler checks are basically
   [processes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24445711) people in your
    company come to depend on to be efficient and productive.
* People more interested in computers than me [doing things to make them
  break](https://twitter.com/Gankra_/status/1167077467359764480)
* I get quite bothered when people's blogs don't show the date an article was
  published. I want to have a grasp on how to discount the value of the
  knowledge a person has decided to share with the world.
