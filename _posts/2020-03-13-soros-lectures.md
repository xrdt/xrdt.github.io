Soros has a big bad investing name because he seems to be one of the few people alive who actually knows what they're
doing when it comes to making money grow. I've decided to look a bit deeper into his thinking. I've started by reading
the transcripts of his 2009 lectures on reflexivity at the Central European University, an institute which he founded
in 1991. The links to the official CEU transcripts are broken, but you can probably find a copy of the ["Soros
Lectures"](https://www.amazon.com/Soros-Lectures-Central-European-University/dp/1586488856) at your local library. In
this short 5 lecture compilation, Soros covers the foundations of his theory of
[reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)), how finance and politics have
become corrupted by ignoring reflexivity, and how the world should restructure the global governance system to prevent
future failures like 2007 - 2008 one.

Quotes are taken from the "Soros Lectures" book.

Update 03/23/2020: If you've already steeped yourself in the vagaries of Soros' reflexivity theory and want some qualifications
on its applicability, I highly recommend you peruse the Preface he wrote to the 2nd edition of [<u>The Alchemy of
Finance</u>](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Finance-George-Soros/dp/0471445495/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=alchemy+of+finance&qid=1584980315&sr=8-1).
You can read the Preface [here](https://epdf.pub/the-alchemy-of-finance-reading-the-mind-of-the-market.html).

__Introduction to Reflexivity and Fallibility__:<br>
In situations with thinking participants (all situations involving humans interacting with each other), the participants'
views of the world are partial and distorted (fallibility).[[1]](#1down)<a name="1up"></a> "[Reflexivity] is that these distorted views can
influence the situation to which they relate because false views lead to inappropriate actions." Soros focuses on reflexivity
with distorted views because he's a finance guy and positive feedback loops that result from mispricing of securities (
boom-bust cycles) interest him, but reflexivity is more generally a [circular relationship between cause and
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)).

One example of bad positive feedback reflexivity: Treating drug addicts as criminals creates criminal behavior.<br>
Another example: Individuals are shaped by their environments (society).

Let's break one of these thinking participant's thinking functions into two categories: cognitive function, which is used
to understand the world; and manipulative function, which is used to change the situation to his advantage. The two functions
have opposite directions of relation to the world:

Cognitive function < ---- World < ---- Manipulative Function

If there is a feedback loop between the cognitive and manipulative functions, the cognitive function can't accurately determine
the state of the world. The manipulative outcome can influence the situation but it can't determine the outcome so the outcome will
likely diverge from the participant's intentions. You can begin to understand why a positive feedback loop would form and how it
could lead to disaster. Because of the self-referential (maybe self-fulfilling) nature of our thinking, there is  uncertainty in our
understanding of the world.

Cognitive function < ---- World < ---- Manipulative Function<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|____________________________________________________________________________________________|

> If the cognitive function operated in isolation without any interference from the manipulative function, it could produce knowledge.
> Knowledge is represented by true facts. ... But if there is interference from the manipulative function, the facts no longer serve
> as an independent criterion by which the truth of a statement can be judged because the correspondence may have been brought about by the
> statement changing the facts.

An example:
> "This is a revolutionary moment." That statement is reflexive, and its truth value depends on the impact it makes.

Reflexivity tends to manifest through feedback loops. Negative feedback loops are self-correcting. Positive feedback loops are self-reinforcing.
Economics assumes the world is made of negative feedback loops and hence goes towards equilibrium. Any idiot who's heard of 1929, 1982 debt crisis,
the 2000s Internet Bubble, the 2008 housing crisis, and now the wonderful 2020 Coronavirus debacle can certainly tell you that equilibrium is
not exactly the state of the world. For more context, please see [Ray Dalio's video on How The Economic Machine
Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0). So markets get out of whack in the positive direction (boom). Why do they get out of whack in the
negative direction (bust, correction?). Because at some point objective reality gets so out of line with perception that people realize their mistake and
try to bring things back to the way they were. Except that things are *so far* out of whack that people overcorrect, stimulating a positive feedback loop
in the other direction. Soros calls these situations *fertile fallacies*: "interpretations of reality that are distorted but produce results that
reinforce the distortion".

Still not fully understanding reflexivity? Perhaps try reading the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)) or
reading [another speech by Soros on the topic](http://ritholtz.com/2004/04/the-theory-of-reflexivity-by-george-soros/).

__Application of Reflexivity to Financial Markets__:<br>
What better reason to seek out Soros' wisdom than to learn to make money like he has? Let's dive right in.

Two cardinal principles of reflexivity in the financial markets:
1. "Market prices always distort the underlying fundamentals."
2. "[Financial markets] can affect the so-called fundamentals they are supposed to reflect."

^^"That is the point that behavioral economics is missing: ... it does not concern itself with the effect the mispricing has on the
fundamentals."

How do boom bust processes form?
> A boom bust process is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. The process is liable to be
tested by negative feedback along the way.

You can see the typical timeline such a process takes in the image below. Note how the build up is asymetrically slow. It takes time to build the momentum
of suspension of disbelief. But once panic and fear reaches a critical point, the whole edifice of salt and sand comes tumbling down.<br>
<img src="../../../images/IMG_8910.jpg" alt="Boom Bust Process" width="450" height="220">

It's fairly easy to think of credit-driven boom bust cycles. Real estate is a particularly salient one.
> The trend that precipitates it is that credit becomes cheaper and more easily available; the misconception is that the value of the collateral is independent o
of the availability of credit. ... When credit becomes cheaper and more easily available, activity picks up and real estate values rise. There are fewer
defaults, credit performance improves, and lending standards are relaxed. So at the height of the boom, the amount of credit involved is at its maximum and reversal
precipitates forced liquidation, depressing real estate values.

You can apply the same analysis to the 1982 sovereign debt crisis. In this situation, the creditworthiness of countries was measured with ratios like debt to GDP
or debt service to exports. It was easy to game the system by increasing the circulation of dollars from petrol sales, which improved the debt ratios and encouraged
further misguided investments.

Equity leverage is another way to induce a boom bust cycle.

Note that it is not irrational to jump in and add fuel to the flames of a bubble. If you understand the cycle well enough that you can get out before the
house crumbles on top of you, you can stand to make a pretty penny of other peoples' ["irrational exuberance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance).

Remember that while reflexivity is a powerful tool to help you understand market behavior, it is not the only source of uncertainty. People trade based on forecasts,
the nature of which is inherently uncertain. Forecasts depend on other people's future decisions and thinking, both of which are unknowable at the present.

In order to protect yourself against uncertainty and boom-bust cycles, you should understand Extremistan and Mediocristan. Of course, Soros doesn't put it in quite these
terms, but the concept is equivalent. In near-equilibrium (Mediocristan) situations, fluctuations are random and lend themselves to statistical generalizations. In far-from-
equilibrium situations, the outcomes are generally uncertain but can disrupt the statistical generalizations. In far-from-equilibrium situations "the range of uncertainty
is uncertain and at times can become practically infinite".

How do you protect yourself in far-from-equilibrium situations?
> Uncertainty finds expression in volatility. Increased volatility requires a reduction in risk exposure [or you will be crunched by the rising liquidity preference].

Better to wait until the crisis abates and liquidity preference decreases to ride the inevitable rebound.

With this framework in mind, let's discuss the 2008 financial crisis. This crisis was the result of a long-standing super-bubble around increasing credit and leverage.
> The prevailing misconception was the belief that financial markets are self-correcting and should be left to their own devices. ... I call it market fundamentalism.
The first crises in this super-bubble was the [1982 international banking crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_1982). The next was the portfolio insurance
incident of [October 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_insurance). The third, [savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and
1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis). The fourth the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). Why do these bubbles keep
happening? Because every time one erupts the authorities protect the bad actors and leave the markets to "fix themselves". 2007 - 2008 was the last straw on the camel's
back, but the authorities still did not take any drastic measures to correct the system after that debacle. Lehmann Brothers was bailed out, international trade was crippled,
the financial markets were put on life support, and off we go on our merry way of fiscal and monetary stimuli.

*What does Soros recommend should be done?*<br>
1. The financial authorities should accept responsibility for preventing bubbles from growing too big.
2. In order to control asset bubbles, you must control the money supply *and* credit availability. Margin and minimal capital requirements are the best tools for the job.
Soros believes that top-down instructions to banks to avoid lending to certain "over-heating" sectors help prevent bubbles from forming. He believes China is using that
tactic well.
3. Regulators need to monitor the positions of all major market participants to avoid systemic imbalances. Derivatives like credit default swaps and knockout options
should be regulated or banned.
4. Financial markets evolve in a one-directional, nonreversible manner. Authorities cannot renege on their promise that the major financial institutions of today are
too big to fail. These institutions must be carefully regulated so they do not take on undue risk and create systemic instabilities in the markets.

__Soros' Ideal Society__:<br>
Note: Soros' claims his vision of an "Open Society" comes from Popper's [<u>Open Society and Its Enemies</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies).
[Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1039842312061374464) claims that Soros has it backwards and that Popper's "Open Society" is the exact opposite of what he
thinks is ideal.

Popper's argument in favor of an open society: "only democracy provides an institutional framework that permits reform without violence, and so the use of reason in politics
matters." Anybody's who's ever seen a US election play out knows that truth seeking (the cognitive function) is clearly not the primary objective of the endless campaigning
and promising to build walls and promises to throw money out of helicopters and "I approve this message"s and posturing and sending emails from secret servers. The main
objective in politics is to get reelected and stay in power as long as possible. The manipulative function takes precedence over the cognitive function. The American populace
has gotten used to being manipulated by [1984 style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) Newspeak. In fact, the populace practically invites deception. It's
certainly more entertaining than doing the critical work to be informed.

As Marshall McLuhan emphasized and reemphasized in his seminal [<u>Understanding Media</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media), the artists saw past the
Enlightenment-era obsession with fixed, objective reality (which works well for analyses in the hard sciences) and developed the postmodern worldview: "it denied the
existence of an objective reality that could be discovered by reason; instead it saw reality as a collection of often contradictory narratives". This postmodern worldview
has let politics spiral way out of control in its quest for power:
> Now that we have discovered that reality can be manipulated, why should the cognitive function be given precedence? Why not engage directly in manipulation? Why not
pursue power rather than truth?

The answer is that pursuit of power through manipulation of reality is self-destructive. Eventually the manipulated reality will differ so far from intentions (every dystopia
ever written) that society will implode (or explode?). We cannot forget that the outcomes of our actions are still governed by a natural force that is larger than any of us,
even when combined. Thus, in order to ensure the continued efficacy of our actions, we must continually adjust our understanding of reality. Of course, if the negative effects
of running amok and disregarding reality can only be felt well after the span of one's tenure, there may not be anything that can stop nasty behavior. Soros believes the one fact
that will strike fear of and respect for objective reality into people's souls is death. That feels like a weak argument, but perhaps the megalomaniacal dictators who would
try to take over the world (ahem, Soros points a fat finger at Bush and his oily pockets) are terrified of death. Everybody has an internal scorecard, whether or not they
admit it.

Let's close this section with some qualifying statements on what it takes to make an open (democratic) society successful. First, some thoughts on the Founding Fathers of the US
and why the Constitution was well structured:
> Open society can prevail only when people can speak truth to power. It needs the rule of law that guarantees freedom of speech and press, free of association and assembly. ...
They empower citizens to defend themselves against the abuse of power and to make use of the judicial branch for such defenses. This is how the Founding Fathers created an open society.

> Open society ... enables a society to understand the problems confronting it and to deal with them more successfully than other forms of social organizations, *provided* it gives
precedence to the cognitive function... and the people are willing to confront harsh realities.

> The instrumental value of democracy is conditional on the electorate's commitment to the pursuit of truth. ... Open society also has an intrinsic value, namely, the freedom
of the individual.

Soros believes that China's lack of recognition of the importance of the freedom of the individual will only become more important in coming years, as China expands its global
presence.

__Soros on the Principal Agent Problem, Market Fundamentalism, and Ethics__:<br>
The [agency problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal–agent_problem) is intractable without appeal to values / morals / ethics. It's impossible to wipe self-interest and
its negative externalities off of people's minds.[[2]](#2down)<a name="2up"></a> One issue is that values are not particularly closely governed by objective reality. They're more
influenced by environment. And our environment has been poisoned by "market fundamentalism", or the application of amoral market values (money is fungible; every actor in a market
is the same as every other; individual decisions have a negligible effect on prices; therefore individuals aren't responsible for prices changes; oh I almost forgot to mention that
markets are self-correcting, thanks to an invisible hand; so who needs you regulators; go play golf instead) to other spheres of social life, esp. politics.

> Economic theory claims in conditions of general equilibrium [which, obviously, should be all the time], the invisible hand assures the optimum allocation of resources. This means that
people pursuing their self interest are indirectly also serving the public interest. It gives self-interest and the profit motive a moral imprimatur that allows them to replace virtues
like honesty, integrity, and concern for others.

^ This is a big reason Soros is so against market fundamentalism and the amoral situation we've let capitalism get polluted into. Consider that he's already railed against general equilibrium.
A disbelief in equilibrium basically invalidates the entire premise of applying market theory beyond the economists' perfect playground of rational, equilibrium seeking homo economicus.

Despite the rational, impassioned argument from a [HIPPO](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hippo+highes+paid&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), market fundamentalism has taken over
because it pays for special interests to lobby and manipulate people into believing that market mechanisms are efficient for determining public interest. It also pays for special interests
to have a stranglehold on efficient market / invisible hand theory so the government will keep their hands off the market and let smart, nefarious people get rich. It pays to influence
people to believe that the efficient market can align self interest with general interest. Soros is in favor of relatively low government market regulation, but that's because he's trying
to minimize the effect of the agency problem among elected officials on something so pervasive and influential as the markets. Soros' resolution to the agency problem appeals to people's
moral virtues and [love for truth](http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf). Some goodhearted, brave people must fight for constraining pursuit of self-interest
to the markets and for protecting and encouraging the electorate's commitment to the pursuit of truth. Hard to say we'll see people willing to risk their reputation and careers to do such a thing
now, but history is full of surprises.

__The Global Financial System__:<br>
Our international financial woes begin after World War II, with the establishment of the IMF and World Bank. Basically, rich countries (ahem US) got a lot of votes and basically controlled
the boards. The US is the main rich country in those orgs, and since the USD is the main international currency, it is the kingpin of the whole international financial system. There are
several other countries with similar status as the US: those that can issue debt in their own currency. Then there are those periphery countries that have to borrow in one of the currencies
from the countries that are [invited to the US's cocktail parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetalia:_Axis_Powers). What this means is that if any individual country is endangered, they
get an impartial evaluation and smidge of assistance. If the US cocktail party gets endangered, everybody's got to drop their shrimp cocktail and pitch in to make sure the boat doesn't capsize.
We saw this "ship is flooding!" mechanism kick in in 2007 - 2008. Eastern Europe was the worst hit after the US government failed to save Lehmann Brothers.

You may think that things are fine and dandy and that we've managed to pull a pretty good recovery after 2007 - 2008. But there is still a fundamental issue with the structure of the
international financial system: "Global markets need global regulations, but the regulations that are currently in force are rooted in the principle of national sovereignty." That means
self-interest of each country for itself can rear its ugly head above international well being when things go south. Soros argues that we need to create international regulation to ensure
the future well-being of globalization.

Now that the US financial system has been exposed for its excessive indebtedness, the world may need to reorganize with a new financial leader. China is perhaps the best candidate, given
how unaffected it was by 2007 - 2008. China practices a form of "state capitalism", which is centrally controlled and fundamentally distinct from "international capitalism", which advocates for
the abolition of regulation and free trade and transparency among participating countries. Soros advocates for holding another [Bretton Woods style
conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference) to figure out the lay and rules of the land for the next period of global financial development. The US should be willing to
submit to the changes because it's clear that the existing system can no longer support the future. China should be willing to submit to such a system because if it wants to continue along
its (imperialistic) growth path, it must make itself liked among its peers. Moving forward requires the US to acknowledge its broken financial and democratic systems and work to guide the
public opinion back to one that aligns with reality. It also requires China to build a more open society, because the world will (hopefully) never subordinate itself to the Chinese leadership.

Well, this has a been a fun ride. I hope you got something out of reading my rendition of Soros. I am open to feedback and questions on this piece through my
[email](mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog).

[[1]](#1up)<a name="1down"></a>There are *so* many resources to help you understand more about theories of perception and the inaccuracies
that result from our brain making sense of the data stream that's flowing in. I've only a bit of the literature, but you
can start with [this paper on schizophrenia](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.schres.2017.11.032) and perhaps this paper
on the [interface theory of perception](http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdfz) and maybe this paper on
[perception as inference](https://www.amazon.com/Predictive-Mind-Jakob-Hohwy/dp/0199686734).

[[2]](#2up)<a name="2down"></a>
Here's where I disagree. Self interest, is, as I put it, always on people's minds. Consider even the repeated, long-term prisoner's dilemma game. It's pretty obvious
why Dawkins titled his book ["The Selfish Gene"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene). It is in each participant's selfish, rational, reward-maximizing interest to
engage in a tit for tat strategy. In most human interactions, the thinking is similar. It is in your selfish, rational, reward-maximizing interest to be nice to the waiter. It
is in your selfish, rational, reward-maximizing interest to cut toxic people out of your life. It is in your selfish, rational, reward-maximizing interest to do things that
you enjoy. The one area where I don't think I can apply this thinking is to children. For modern people, having children doesn't necessarily align with their their lifestyles.
But they are pressured to have children because...older people like passing on their genes and not having just their grumpy adult children for the occasional Thanksgiving and
Christmas hoopla. For other people, it's not financially sane. For some people, sex feels good and oh I forgot a condom or oh I forgot to take birth control yesterday and
bam now she's pregnant but we can't have an abortion because...(easily manipulated) moral values say no. I'm not saying people always behave rationally, but at least for
Soros' case, we live in a reflexive world where we can observe what society will reward us for certain actions and we conform to that reward system, shaping it as it shapes
us. I sometimes think about how much Google has gotten better vs. how much new users have learned to use Google better. I'd venture that probably 70%+ is Google's improvement.
Anyway, people don't always behave out of pure compassion. There can be some game theoretic "I'll see these guys again it makes sense not to toss napalm in this village and
destroy every last living creature I see because I'm peeved" or "I want to lord over these knuckle brained farmers that make my country run for as long as possible so let me
not be too aggressive and bash their brains in with high taxes and oppressive laws" calculations going on behind the scenes.
