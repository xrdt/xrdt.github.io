I went out this weekend to three exciting restaurants. You can take a look
at the restaurants still on my checklist by going to ["Useful Links"](https://xrdt.github.io/useful_links.html) > ["Places in LA to Try"](https://www.google.com/maps/d/drive?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221GreGY5Qg9mkl-7PdJSZtlDG668JZweZW%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22118358355554637075599%22%7D&usp=sharing).

The first was [Thien An Bo 7 Mon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/thien-an-bo-7-mon-rosemead-2),
In Rosemead. This is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant with pho and
[bun cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_cha) (my personal favorite). If
you want that kind of Vietnamese, I'd suggest you go a bit northwest to
[Golden Deli](https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-deli-san-gabriel-san-gabriel-2).
Back to Thien An. Thien An Bo 7 Mon is a higher end Vietnamese restaurant,
specializing in the [Bo 7 Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bò_7_món)
that is a Saigon classic. Bo 7 Mon is $23 as of last Saturday. Thien An also
serves whole catfish and vinegar hot pots and other "cook yourself" meats like
boar and shrimp. The cook yourself portion is like kbbq but Vietnamese style.
You get a small, oiled up cast iron plate on which to fry some marinated
boar or shrimp or beef. It's certainly a sight to see and a great place to
invite family and friends for a fancier dinner.

I chickened out of paying for a $20+ entree and instead ordered the fried
rice. The fried rice was nothing special (as expected), but it filled me up
for the night. The friend I went with ordered the cook yourself on a cast
iron griddle wild boar, which came with all the classic toppings you need
for making rice paper spring rolls. I chickened out of trying his food, but
it looked pretty tasty. The table next to us ordered something like $140 worth
of cook your own meats. They had 5 people, and the portion seemed just right
for the two voracious men and three women of medium appetite.

I probably won't be going back to Thien An Bo 7 Mon unless I have a party to
plan, but it certainly deserves a place on my list for its flair.

Yesterday was a whole different kind of food adventure. I took two classmates
out to Chinatown to try out Eddie Huang's BaoHaus and Mr. Churro. I've
been wanting to go to NYC to get BaoHaus since, like, years ago. I'm a die
hard for Taiwanese street food, and Eddie's stuff looked legit. Those crushed
peanuts and 酸菜? Mmm. So we booked an Uber and headed on down into China
Town. BaoHaus is in this alley with Ten Ren's tea and a whole bunch of other
stuff. They don't have a raging line, but the shop next door, Howlin' Ray's,
has got a line wrapping around the downstairs plaza. That place is on my list
for next time.

Anyway, BaoHaus is a nondescript little counter shop that plays some lit hip
hop and has a vintage letter board. The walls have graffiti and polaroid
covered wooden boards. The feeling is exactly as I expected. I ordered the
Chairman Mao, which is the classic pork belly bao, and the Birdhaus, which
lays a popcorn chicken type piece of fried bird between the bread. The meats
were very tender and fresh. The pork belly was very tender and nicely
seasoned. The Birdhaus has a beautiful crunch and got the flavor just right.
I just wish the Birdhaus was a tad more spicy.
The other complaints are that there weren't enough condiments
on my baos. Not enough peanuts, not enough 酸菜. I guess I'll have to ask for
extra of those if I go back.

After we chowed down some baos, we went walking through Chinatown to Mr.
Churro, an establishment known for its filled churros. I got two filled
churros, guava and lechere, for $3.75 each. Plain churros are $2.75 each. The
money is well spent. One, the churros are huge and fresh, two the flavors are
gorgeous. A friend got a raspado, which was huge and more than enough for
two people with average appetites. I have a personal love for condensed milk,
so lechere was by far the superior choice on filling. The filling may be too
rich for some people, so just go for the plain if you're afraid it will be
too sweet. Mr. Churro also serves ice cream and juices and classic Mexican
foods. I guess I'll have to go back for a full meal and dessert next time.

If you're like us an live in Pasadena, pay attention to the Mini Storage
sign next time you come back along the 110. They sometimes have quirky messages
on the board. It once said: " Smile while you still have teeth. " Yesterday's
message had something to do with apples. The other side said something about
drive through coffee. Google Street View will reveal some of the messages.

All three places I mentioned today are now on my [Places in the World I Like](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bTAeuBmHI4WKqJV7CktD1k_zM-7M1FmV&usp=sharing) map. Need a review on another place on that list? I'd be happy to supply it.
As usual, contact info is at the top of the page.
