<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>The titles of my posts are frequently only relevant to the beginning
parts of my posts because I become inspired while writing. So don't judge a
post by its title! Jump right in and see what other gems I've hidden further
down the page.</p>

<h3>Update: Feb 15, 2018</h3>
<p>I'm currently migrating the Google Drive posts onto this site. I will make
new posts starting today onto this site.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Older thoughts are archived on <a href="https://drive.google.com/embeddedfolderview?id=0Bw28gWUp26esbGtLUEZzSkdVSGc#list">Google Drive</a>.<p>

{% assign postsByYearMonth = site.posts | group_by_exp:"post", "post.date | date: '%Y %b'"  %}
{% for yearMonth in postsByYearMonth %}
  <h3>{{ yearMonth.name }}</h3>
    <ul>
      {% for post in yearMonth.items %}
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} {{ post.title }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
