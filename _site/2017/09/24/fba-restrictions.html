  <h1>FBA Restrictions and Process</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 24, 2017</h3>

<p>I’ve been trying to push <a href="http://facebook.com/kanberrajapan">this product</a> to the Taiwanese market for a couple of weeks now, since the Japanese market hasn’t responded well to my ads. I’ve even created an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/KanberraJapan/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=131480954250489">album of Chinese-language images</a> which explain our products’ selling points just to excite this market.</p>

<p>Today, I found out that our products cannot be shipped internationally. This is due to a FBA limitation. It seems all my effort was wasted.</p>

<p>I think this result arose because I failed to establish a clear process for gathering information about this platform and setting up our product. When I was tasked with researching Amazon FBA for Japan, I basically searched “Amazon FBA Japan” in Google and clicked on every relevant link. I had no experience selling online, so I was trying to be a sponge and soak up all the little bits of information I could find on this topic. That worked out ok, and it got us far enough to have product shipped to an Amazon warehouse and ready for sale. But that process didn’t get me far enough to know all the details and pitfalls of our next few months trying to sell the product. I suppose this is ok, since I’m still learning, but I notice this behavioral pitfall in everything else I do. I tend not to follow schedules or routines. I just do things depending on my mood, which means I frequently skimp on important activities due to lack of time and that I am constantly frazzled because I don’t know what to do next.</p>

<p>Is it time for me to turn to Atul Gawande’s favorite tool: the checklist? It would certainly help organize my thoughts, but I think my problem is rooted in my view of the world. I would rather be petulant and wish for a world I want, rather than be professional and work with the world as it is. Because of this attitude, I seek to maximize my pleasure at the expense of my productivity. Opportunity cost is massive with this self-destructive behavior.</p>

<p>This week, I will try meditating to calm my mind and focus on what it is important. I struggle daily with what I value and what I am seeking in life. That is why I never know which opportunities I should take on and am constantly seeking affirmation from people I respect. I need to learn to think for myself and reach for what I love in life, because my life will be dragged from me if I keep dreaming.</p>
