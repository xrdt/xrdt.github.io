  <h1>Expectations</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 15, 2017</h3>

<p>I wrote the title for this post in a very agitated state of mind. My agitation was entirely brought on by the prospect of having my expectations dashed.</p>

<p>Expectations are necessary to set boundaries on what is to be completed. This is the mindset of a lower-level employee. They need greater guidance and clearer objectives to orient their daily work. Higher-level employees function more in terms of processes. They seek to develop an organization with certain characteristics by enforcing certain behavioral patterns and social norms. Certainly, they have goals to achieve as well, but the goal tends to be further off and phrased more as a vision.</p>

<p>The problem with expectations and goal-setting as your primary motivator is that you are enforcing an emotional rollercoaster upon yourself. You feel great when you achieve your goals, but you fall into a depressive lull now that you don’t have something else to do. You have to come up with another target to achieve. You feel terrible when you don’t achieve your goals, and the good feelings that come when you finally do achieve them (if you haven’t already given up) are diminished by the initial failure. This is why most people fail to achieve long-term behavioral changes. They are able to get to the level they desire (for example, losing X pounds or saving X dollars for retirement), but they are unable to create habits that will maintain or improve upon this level. They no longer have a distinct goal to reach for, because now the new objective is based in a process (for example, maintaining Y weight, adding Y dollars to your retirement account every paycheck).</p>

<p>The process is sometimes just developing good habits. You rewire your brain to associate pleasure with your new lifestyle choices, and slowly build your preferences. The greatest achievements are largely the result of persistence and process. Work on your projects and your skills every day, and you will, over time, get better at them. It’s just that simple.</p>

<p>The emotional rollercoaster associated with expectations has so far been disastrous for me. I anchor way too heavily on expectations, becoming uncontrollably angry and impatient when the possibility of failing to meet my expectations is raised. This is partly because I expect the world to work the way I want. I am petty and petulant, and I can’t bear to think that I don’t have enough money, power, or reputation to get things exactly to my specifications. All of these expectations are stupid, like my gripes with ridesharing. (I’m not giving up on the dream of car ownership, though.) I must thank everybody in my life for having put up with my ridiculous attitude and arrogance and outbursts. Slowly, but surely, I am maturing and chipping away at the edifice of my ego.</p>

<p>This post was partially inspired by this Farnam Street post on Amateurs and Professionals:<a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/">https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/</a></p>

<p>Below are a series of posts regarding the power of FAGA (FB, Apple, GOOG, AMZN). The conclusions drawn are scary, and I mostly feel helpless, like “How can I survive without using Google or FB?”. But these thoughts are just the beginning of a revolution that some hope will be resolved with the decentralized future blockchain promises. I hope you enjoy the links.</p>

<p>今天是我數期實習的最後一天！我的負擔終於鬆開了。幸虧我的責任今天都完成了，要不然我下一個禮拜有要去辦公室，解決一大堆我再也不想看到的問題。坐在我附近的一些同事有跟我說再見，淡大部分的人要是不知道我要走了或是根本不想理我。我們公司這麼小，只有二十人，但關西沒有特別溫暖。辦公室的另一邊跟我做的地方隔著一大牆，所以我不常見到那邊的人。還有，我們平常沒有一起吃飯，都是個做個的習慣。我雖然很喜歡工作環境的自由我還是認為友情比較好的公司會讓我比較高興。</p>

<p>我老闆昨天問我下個暑假要不要再回來一次。我對這件事不只可否，所以沒特別說什麼。我其實不太想在做這工業的實習了，我該去看看高科技或初創是怎麼工作，那一邊比較適合我的態度和我的技術。我也要想我可以在哪裡發展得比較快。直到我發現我身命的意義時，每一家公司、每一次機會只是我的跳板，能讓我升到更高的職位。你們應該可以用歸納法想下去吧，如果我到最頂還沒滿足，我還可以去哪裡？那時，我應該辭職，用我累積的存錢去找出真正的我。去森林靜坐，傳教，環遊，這都是常見的心理治療方式。我希望我可以依賴神，叫祂救我，不要讓我調到哪種無法挽救的坑裡。阿們。</p>
