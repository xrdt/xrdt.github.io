  <h1>Separation of Phone and Computer</h1>

<p>I have now separated the roles of my phone and computer. I started doing this a couple of weeks ago, because I didn’t want to be so distracted by technology. To start, I turned off almost all badges and notifications on my computer and removed all unnecessary apps from my dock. I then removed FB Messenger and Twitter from my phone. Today, I removed Mail from my phone. This was partly inspired by the Apple announcement yesterday. For some reason, after they revealed the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, I wanted to even further remove myself from this world of incessant, flashing lights and buzzers and pop-ups.</p>

<p>My phone is now reserved for calls, voicemail, text messaging, Google Maps, Lyft, a Chinese-English dictionary, Calendar, Notes, and Pictures. I’m tempted to remove Calendar, but I’m so forgetful that this would probably triple my flake percentage. My computer is now reserved for email, FB Messenger, FB for work (I manage pages), the Internet, and coding. I hope this separation will help me calm my mind so I can focus on creating awesome content and tools and selling amazing products.</p>

<p>Speaking of products, please take a look at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B003QK6L40?m=A1JE8I7I5A0A2E&amp;ref_=v_sp_widget_detail_page">Kanberra Gel</a> (JP). Kanberra Gel is an all-natural tea tree oil air purifier that will clean your air like nothing else. It completely removes odors, kills bacteria, is antimicrobial and antifungal and antiseptic, and is great as an insect repellant. In addition to the gels, we sell sprays which you can use as deodorant, insect repellant, and hair spray, wipes, and soap. You can find us on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KANBERRA-GEL-524002-Natural-Purifier/dp/B003QK60YQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505356953&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=kanberra+gel&amp;psc=1">Amazon US</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B003QK6L40?m=A1JE8I7I5A0A2E&amp;ref_=v_sp_widget_detail_page">Amazon JP</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kanberragel.com/">our website</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goldilocks-usa.com/us-polvsampler.htm">Goldilocks Ube Cookies</a>. A coworker left some of these cookies in the office, and I’ve really grown to like them. They’re quite sandy and light. The sweetness may be a bit overbearing, but it’s slightly tempered by an exotic flavor of ube, or purple yam. You can order online at the link I included.</p>
