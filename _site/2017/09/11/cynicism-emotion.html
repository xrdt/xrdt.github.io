  <h1>Cynicism and Emotion</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 11, 2017</h3>

<p>Cynicism is a form of death for the soul. Those who are cynical have dulled their pain. They have reasoned it away by choosing to believe mankind’s failures are inevitable. Because everything is inevitable, they are now free to stop caring. There is nothing worth trying striving for, because everything will come to a miserable end, anyway. This is the beginning of the end for man.</p>

<p>I lived much of my high school life a cynical fool. To use harsher words would be appropriate, but I am trying to control my tongue. I hated everybody because they were stupid to even bother trying when it was evident there was no future for them. They were not smart enough to lead the world, not smart enough to make a comfortable living, not smart enough to live without their parents’ significant support, etc. They were the stupid ones of my world. And I was the smart one, the one who saw through the fake niceties and understood true human nature. And yet most of these people were the happiest. I was the blind moose who was drowning in misery. I projected my anger and hatred and eventual resigned discontent onto everybody who seemed to be enjoying life more than I did. I simply couldn’t understand how they could love a life that was so cruel.</p>

<p>Now I realize that there is nothing greater for a man than to be full of hope. There is nothing greater than the man who is constantly striving, constantly reaching for the next rung of the ladder that will lead to an existence more fulfilling than the meager one he is currently living. Our existence is defined by struggle. We are put on this Earth to fulfill God’s purpose and to spread God’s word. God is the light, and we must use Him as a lantern to illuminate the darkness and expose the truth. But the darkness fights back with temptation and evil thoughts and sin. Through our struggles, our faith is reaffirmed and we understand more clearly how we can bring glory to God’s name.</p>

<p>Even if all hope is lost for you, there is still hope for others. There is still hope for your family, who eagerly await for you to join in their loving embrace, for your friends, with whom you join in fellowship and Godly growth, for your community, with which you plant the seeds of growth and nurture the next generation, your country, for which you fight for a set of common ideals, and your people, with whom you fight for God and eternal salvation. There is always hope, but that hope may not always be for you.</p>

<p>To have hope, you must have emotion. And thank the Lord we were born with emotions. We were born with emotion to help us make decisions and to understand the world. Our emotions are good for us. We must follow Hemingway’s advice: “Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive.” Let your emotions breathe life into your spirit. Let them flavor your every interaction. Let them enlighten your work. Let your emotions guide you to righteousness and truth and peace.</p>

<p>Do not try to hide your emotions. Stop trying to hide your humanness and instead use emojis to express yourself. A static human face can never express the wild surges that can engulf you and possess you and give your life meaning. Seek the Lord with a humble face and humble heart. Let Him guide you in all your ways. Pray to the God for the courage to follow His path and the meekness to let Him show you the way. Amen.</p>

<p>我本來用隔兩天的時間表因為我不想爆肝。一開始，這種預防是對的，我還沒適應常寫這種文章，所以有一天可以休息會讓我腦筋恢復，讓我比較有寫字的激情。我現在維持一個月的習慣，心裡覺得很舒暢。我從來沒有成功地這樣一貫做一件事。從運動到做功課，我都是跟著很隨便的感情去做的。現在，我想成就更有意義的項目，最好的方法就需要培養好習慣。</p>

<p>我的暑期實習快完了。我雖然非常不喜歡學校的環境，但我非得回去。我還沒找到我喜歡的工作，還沒找到我喜歡的工作環境，只好回學校，等待著我的機會。看到那種機會以後就要立刻地去掌握，否則那瞬間以後再也不會見到。反正我最終的夢想是賺夠錢，逃離世界的束縛。</p>
