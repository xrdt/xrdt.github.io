  <h1>Workplace Culture</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 10, 2017</h3>

<p>There’s a bit too much fantasizing about how awesome tech company perks are. Casual dress, free food, ping pong tables, beer outings, and nap rooms sound nice, but they all help perpetuate the radically insular Silicon Valley startup culture. Why? Because all these perks demand more and more buy-in across the company for everybody to feel comfortable working there. As Rich Armstrong says in his post below: “When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same.”</p>

<p>Work is about work. It is about achieving goals and shipping. It helps to not hire complete jerkfaces, but everybody can be courteous and decent without being best friends. We can get straight to building great software or connecting people or creating new ways to experience music. And if people want to have fun outside of work? So be it. Just don’t morph the idea of socializing into “being a team player” and “team bonding” so someone’s career depends on it.</p>

<p>I don’t have many more thoughts to share on this, so just read Rich’s post. I’m sure you’ll get more out of it that way.</p>
