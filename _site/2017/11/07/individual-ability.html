  <h1>Individual Ability</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">November 7, 2017</h3>

<p>I had nothing to write yesterday. I apologize for those who were waiting for my 1 - 2 day blog updates.</p>

<p>I have problems getting work done individually. I have grown so accustomed to working on assignments with my classmates at set times that I can’t find the motivation to start working early, alone. This isn’t a terrible problem, but I do sometimes lament about my lack of individual ability. I fear that one day, I will fail to to demonstrate some basic knowledge or ability because I relied too much on others to provide those items.</p>

<p>My teammates are all individual contributors. They each bring something worthwhile to the table. I don’t want to be that fool who is retained because they feel uncomfortable kicking me out. I don’t want to be the burden who asks questions which have obvious answers and slows down progress. I want to be seen as a peer, worthy of being onto a team. I want to stand out for something and to be rewarded for my contribution.</p>

<p>This is the way the modern labor economy works. Each person is hired for their demonstrated abilities. Behavioral fit is also evaluated, because companies are now all on messianic missions to change the world and anybody who demonstrates less than overwhelming fervor for the plan to conquer the world is unsuited for employment. Potential is claimed to be evaluated, but how can you evaluate potential without looking at a person’s past abilities? So, really the hiring process is dependent on what you’ve already done. From there, some kind of heuristic is used to evaluate whether a person can grow.</p>

<p>I think hiring is an unfortunate process for both parties. It’s stressful for everybody involved, and success rates tend to be fairly low. Also, most people you hire probably don’t care that much about your revolutionary mission to make the world a better place. They’re probably just happy to have a job and stability in their lives. They probably also need the income to survive and something to do other than play LoL all day long. But our system has largely worked so far. People are largely happy where they work (is this just me being naive) and good work is getting produced.</p>

<p>One major problem I have with the way the work world is set up is the hours. Why do we work eight hours a day for five days a week? I think the two-day weekend should be abolished in favor of a one-day rest period. Two days encourages too much debauchery and accumulation of unsavory habits. The good Lord recommended a six-day work week for a reason, and I think he is right. If we are unable to maintain a six-day workweek, I propose we split the two rest days throughout the week. This way, people don’t have too much time to waste but can still feel rested, especially since the ends of the weeks typically experience low productivity. Maybe my view is just naive. But I think it’s worthwhile to experiment with a six-day or split workweek to see if people perform better and are happier.</p>

<p>That’s all for today. Ping me at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com if you want to chat.</p>
