  <h1>I Want to Be Happy</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 7, 2017</h3>

  <p>My life so far has never been focused on happiness. It has always been focused 
on success. The motivating assumption has been that success will lead to 
happiness. One day, when I can comfortably support my lifestyle, I will be 
happy. I can never know when that day will come. All I can do is hope that it 
will arrive soon. And hold onto that hope I have, for what else can a human 
do in the face of stress? We must maintain a vision for our future, otherwise 
our existence is for naught and we may as well be dead.</p>

<p>The future is what gives us purpose in life. It is the concept of having a 
future that enables us to construct plans for things to come and for how we 
plan to achieve those plans. If every day were uncertain, what would you do? 
If your mandate was to live as though every day were your last, you would do 
nothing but play. You would do nothing but spend your income and time on 
activities and items for your happiness. You would focus on experiencing those 
emotions which characterize human existence. You would fundamentally 
appreciate the expanse of human cognition and truly live.</p>

<p>And what is the lot of those who are not ordered to live as if this day was 
their last? What is the lot of those who are ordered to live with a thought 
for the future? Those are the ordinary people. Those are the people who wake 
up every morning with a thought of making this day better than the last so 
they can create a better future. Those are the people who deposit savings in 
their bank accounts each time they receive a paycheck so they will be able to 
enjoy life in old age. Those are the people who are sacrificing present 
gratification and happiness for the promise that they will be able to 
appreciate the fruits of their labor more when they are ripe, wisened, and 
physically weaker than they are now.</p>

<p>I hope there is conflict in my writing. I long for the day when I shall no 
longer have to suffer for a taste of the elusive dew of future success and 
happiness. I long for a day when I know what my success is. I long for a day 
when I can be happy. When will that day come? I pray it shall be soon, for 
I fear I will not last much longer under the current regime of sacrificing 
my youth for a glorious middle and old age.</p>
