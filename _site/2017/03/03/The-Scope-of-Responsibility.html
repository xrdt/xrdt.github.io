  <h1>The Scope of Responsiblity</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 3, 2017</h3>

  <p>One important key to success that many people, especially young people, don’t 
understand, is that you are responsible for more than yourself. You are 
accountable, to your friends and family, your team at work, your company, your 
neighborhood, and your government. You are responsible for contributing 
your portion of the work to maintain attractive social structure so society 
as a whole benefits. Why is this important? Because intensive growth is a 
result of teamwork. No one person has enough skills to change the world. 
Behind every revolutionary CEO and visionary leader is a team of exceptional 
people who have worked with that leader to create great contributions.</p>

<p>To achieve true success, you must understand the power of creating win-win 
situations. Every situation must be mutually beneficial, because this 
expands your influence and your ability to get things done. Each relationship 
you influence is a play on human emotion. You are molding your emotional 
attraction to each other such that when a risky opportunity or a trying time 
hits you, you will be so emotionally invested that you will agree to continue 
investing in each other. This is the power of influence and relationships. 
As Charlie Munger says: “You don’t want to be like the motion picture exec 
who had so many people at his funeral, but they were there just make sure he 
was dead.” You want to achieve personal success and be recognized, without 
ostracizing those who helped and supported you through the journey.</p>

<p>“Shared joy is double a joy; shared sorrow is half a sorrow.” – Proverb from 
the annals of the Internet hive mind.</p>

<p>Children are now raised to believe in the “Stage 3” culture, which is when
every participant in the group is looking out for himself. This is the 
culture most corporate environments adopt and is characterized by aggressive 
“ladder-climbing”, backstabbing, secrecy, and other corporate memery that is 
exemplified in “Dilbert”. This kind of thinking is dangerous because it 
enforces a very narrow and self-destructive worldview that is entirely 
externally motivated. They work hard because they want to beat the person in 
the office down the hall. They work hard because they want to achieve their 
own selfish view of success. Once they reach their goals and have beaten out 
every possible competitor on their path, they become content and their 
productivity drops. Their life has no greater meaning. They will never change 
the world.</p>

<p>The people who change the world are constantly thinking about strategy that 
extends beyond them into bettering society globally. They work because they 
love what they do. They work because they love creating win-win, mutually 
beneficial relationships. They work because they think 10x. Thinking 10x is 
one step, but achieving 10x requires that you understand and embrace the model 
of work where you seek to fulfill your responsibility to yourself and to your 
stakeholders. Think beyond the present; think beyond your limited worldview 
and create something awesome.</p>

<p>** Note: Stage 3 culture comes from David Logan’s <strong>Tribal Leadership</strong>. **</p>
