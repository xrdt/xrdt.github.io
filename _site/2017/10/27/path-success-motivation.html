  <h1>Path to Success and Motivation</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">October 27, 2017</h3>

<p>I very recently posited that I would only acknowledge two paths to success:
Master a field and become a highly sought after human asset
Accumulate massive wealth and remove myself from society</p>

<p>I was not implying that everybody should strive to follow these paths. These were goals that I thought would be worthwhile for myself.</p>

<p>After thinking about my purpose more, I’ve realized how unhappy I am when I fight to achieve these purely selfish goals. I’ve come to believe more in Matthew 10:39: “He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.”</p>

<p>I think Matthew’s statement should be generalized, so that we can only find things that we completely surrender. For example, in Finite and Infinite Games, Carse notes a “paradox of infinite play: You can have what you have only by releasing it to others. The sounds of the words you speak may lie on your own lips, but if you do not relinquish them entirely to a listener they never become words, and you say nothing at all.” (pg. 82).</p>

<p>The concept of an infinite game that is played for the goal of continuing the game is very beautiful and calming. I’ve held onto this book for the sake of reaffirming my faith in the idea of the infinite game. I want to become an infinite player, but this requires that I slowly give up the masks and responsibilities that I have come to believe in as a finite player. It will be a slow, painful process, but I think it is all the more worthy for its struggle. This is not to say that every struggle is worthwhile. You can certainly struggle fruitlessly in the wrong direction. But if what you are struggling for is truly profound, then do not give up. Men frequently give up the fight too soon. They just do not know how close they are to the brink of discovery when they let go.</p>

<p>I certainly hope my writings have become better over the couple of months I have been maintaining this blog. One day, I will need to port this writing onto my website, so that interested users can search my writings and so I can more easily run through my past thoughts. It is only by reviewing my history that I can regard it as past and understand my progress.</p>

<p>I have seen this truth many times, but I still do not appreciate its truth: Motivation does not determine success. Motivation is a fleeting feeling. It comes and goes at the most inconvenient times. Anyone who relies on the flights of motivation that strike them throughout the day cannot achieve greatness. Motivation falls flat in effectiveness when compared with discipline and habit. To discipline your mind is like to sharpen a dull piece of metal. As useless as the raw metal is, so is your untrained mind. We must work hard on a daily basis to refine our abilities and our perspective on the world. Everyone takes for the limits of the world the limits of his own vision. Work hard to challenge your models of the world. Work hard to go forwards, backwards, sideways, and upside down in your thinking as many times as possible, for it is only in this thoroughness of thought that you can discover the truth. Go out and discover that refined, beautiful, silky truth. Let it touch you and heal you.</p>

<p>Also read Finite and Infinite Games, because this is a book that will absolutely shake up your world view.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. I hope you have enjoyed today’s posts and have enjoyed my previous posts. If you are interested in conversing further with me, please ping me at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
