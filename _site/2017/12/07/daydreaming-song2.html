  <h1>Daydreaming and Song #2</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">December 7, 2017</h3>

<p>Today, I started watching HBO’s “The Wire”. That show is really a piece of art. Even from the first episode I can feel myself falling in love with the story, the filmmaking, the dialogue, etc. Good television is really a beautiful mesh of the director’s vision, the writers’ imagination, and the actors’ ingenuity. I look forward to continuing the series.</p>

<p>I also watched “The Usual Suspects” recently. That was quite the movie. It got boring at quite a few points in the middle, but the ending really jolted me. The entire story was fabricated using clues on the corkboard behind the detective. Remarkable storytelling, but it leaves me with a jumble of questions about what’s real to work through.</p>

<p>I find myself daydreaming a lot. I tend to daydream either by reliving past events or by creating a mental sequence of how I want some future event to go. For example, today, during a lab meeting, I started daydreaming about what I’m going to do when I go to Aspen over winter break. I started thinking about how I’m going to pick up my lift tickets, get my rental equipment, go down the slope to the lift, etc. I didn’t even realize I was daydreaming until I suddenly snapped out of the fantasy to start paying attention. I don’t even know how I snapped out. These daydreams are like dreams. My consciousness flows so smoothly between reality and the dream that I don’t even notice the change in scenery until I get shaken out of my subconscious. I suppose you could call this maladaptive daydreaming because I do it so frequently. It’s become quite the distraction. But it doesn’t seem to be enough of a distraction to keep me off the internet at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>Ok. Here’s today’s attempt at some rhyming.</p>

<p>快點給我戒菸
不想戒就給我抽籤
抽得好就給我上天
上天看著星星 星球飛過
再回來給我做個報告</p>

<p>外面的世界變得怎樣
太空這最後的邊境長得多棒
是否能跟外星人談星</p>

<p>小時候常夢離家出走
得到自由後的美景有多猛
但老了卻多想打坐坡
一提出搬家換景身就開始顫抖
你還能暸解我的心情嗎
還是現在只剩我和你媽這些上代人</p>

<p>老了才能深刻體驗孤獨和寂寞
年輕人的笑容多麽陌
好朋友早就離世
只剩我們幾個還在喘氣
人聲最痛苦的一段就是你最落寞的那一段</p>
