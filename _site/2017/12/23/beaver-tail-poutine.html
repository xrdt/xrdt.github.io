  <h1>Beaver Tails and Poutine</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">December 23, 2017</h3>

<p>Today I had my first Canadian Beaver Tail pastry. We were walking around Mont Tremblant village and saw a bunch of people going into the store selling the pastries, so we decided to satisfy our curiosity and get the basic cinnamon sugar + lemon coated one. It was a lot lighter than I expected, but the flavor was quite impressive. The lemon really tied everything together. I’d recommend a taste of the pastry if you get a chance to find one of the stores in Canada.</p>

<p>I also had a taste of Smoke’s poutine. I’d had the basic poutine before, so I figured I’d try their double pork combo, with pulled pork and bacon in addition to the standard gravy and cheese curds. Something was lacking in the flavor with this dish, but all the ingredients were of reasonable quality. Perhaps I’ll need to hunt down another place for poutine that can satisfy my palette.</p>

<p>My time in Quebec is giving me a slight frustration about not knowing French. I have yet to run into a circumstance where I need to know the language, but it seems like it would be fun to converse with people in their native languages. I tried learning Russian on Duolingo recently, but I quickly got tired of trying to keep up with the program. That’s a dumb excuse to stop learning, but I’ll focus on improving my Chinese for now.</p>

<p>Lack of motivation is such a terrible excuse to stop doing anything. Motivation is fickle and your enemy. It is relatively easy to get motivated to do something once you’ve gotten some momentum and moved into a flow state. Once you’re there, you’re well ahead of those who decided they would rather sit on the couch and do nothing for the day. Some activities take more effort to get into a flow state, but the flow state is still waiting there for you. You just have to build up the habit of taking action rather than procrastinating. A habit really is just something with less activation energy than the alternative. It takes less activation energy for me to play video games and listen to music for an afternoon than read some papers on SLAM. But, eventually, I can tip the scales so that I’d prefer being productive for the day. The sooner I correct my psychology and preferences, the better off I will be. I truly believe that once I get over the fear of taking action and failing to achieve objectives on a personal project, I will accomplish great things.</p>

控制心情掌握健康
多吃水果多運動 健康不只是身體的問題
身心互相影響 有時高有時低
我寫到現在已沒辭可繼續</p>
