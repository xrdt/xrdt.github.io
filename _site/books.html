    <h1>Books I Like</h1>

    <p>I believe the print book is far better than the digital version.
       The flashing of a screen slows down your reading speed and distracts
       you from going into the book.</p>

    <p>Some excuses for reading digital books is that digital books are
       cheaper and more portable. You could also say that reading free pdfs of
       books is a good way to sample the work before you decide to buy it.
    </p>

    <p>I would argue that there is no need to have your entire library on your
       person at every moment of every day in your Kindle or other e-book
       reader. How often is it so absolutely necessary for you to search
       through your library of books for some morsel of information or for
       some passage? Each moment you spend reading should be one of deep
       concentration and immersion. Do not treat reading as some fickle,
       temporary activity you do to appear smart or out of necessity. When you
       read, you are enriching your mind by diving into the author's universe.
       Cherish that moment, because it is impossible to recreate.</p>

    <p>If you want to sample books, go to your local library. If you are too
       poor or too miserly to buy books, use your local library. It is
       rare that one re-references books, anyway. There are few books in this
       world that are worth owning. Save your money for those books.</p>

    <p>Below is a list of books that I have enjoyed over the years. I own
       physical copies of all of them.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts</li>
        <li>Elegant Objects, Vol 1 and 2, by Yegor Bugayenko</li>
        <li>Finite and Infinite Games, by James Carse</li>
    </ul>
