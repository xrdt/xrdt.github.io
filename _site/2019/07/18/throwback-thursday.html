  <h1>Throwback Thursday</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">July 18, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />

<p>I was going through some shelves yesterday, trying to find old things to
throw away, when I came across a green notebook from my middle school years.
I opened it up, expecting to find some illegible stream of consciousness from
my 13-year-old self, but I found my old comics instead. Don’t get too excited,
these comics don’t have much artistic or storytelling quality to them, but
they reminded me of the cool things I used to do, before I went to college and
got serious about making myself job-worthy and surviving under the
back-crushing workloads. Today’s post is all about prying open the jar of
nostalgia I have within me for the activities that filled my “formative”,
pre-college years.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comics
    <ul>
      <li>This was an activity I continued until I started 9th grade, I think.
I can’t remember exactly when I started drawing comics, maybe 5th grade.</li>
      <li>[So it turns out I wasn’t stupid and documented most of the characters
at some point].</li>
      <li>Kaitlyn Joe commissioned comics from me that I never delivered in
Mr Covington’s English class in 7th grade.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Orchestra (good old Marina Hall)
    <ul>
      <li>In 5th grade, the middle school orchestra and band came and gave us a
performance. This was intended to enlighten us as to the possible
instruments we could play if we joined either group. I decided to join
orchestra and play viola, because I preferred classical music and because
“everyone else wanted to play violin”.</li>
      <li>The great thing about that school’s program was that it was basically a
massive group instrument class. We were given instruments to use free of
charge and were taught, from step zero, how to play. I ended up joining
the “honors orchestra” in 7th grade.</li>
      <li>I switched schools in 8th grade. The orchestra in the new school was more
advanced, and I wasn’t very serious about pursuing music on my own, so I
gave up the instrument after the 8th grade musical (Guys and Dolls), for
which I was a pit member.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tennis
    <ul>
      <li>I played this sport for many years as a child. I continued this sport the
longest, even playing it through my second year of college. At some point,
my frustration with not having players at my level to hit with and my
frustration with not having time to practice caused me to drop it.</li>
      <li>The other major sport I played growing up was golf. I never had enough
patience to really play golf well. I only liked hitting the ball hard and
far, so my putting and short game were always disasters.</li>
      <li>I dabbled in weightlifting during high school, since that was a more fun
PE than a sport or generic PE. I eventually got tired of being a gym rat
and decided to focus on bodyweight exercises and mobility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Theater
    <ul>
      <li>I did Odyssey of the Mind in 9th grade and took theater as an art elective
between 10th and 11th grade. I was never good at theatre, but it was, I
suppose, an ok enough way to spend my art period time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CTY
    <ul>
      <li>Good old Center for Talented Youth. I took this program twice, once in
some kind of math curriculum and once in some kind of architecture
curriculum. Neither program was particularly useful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sailor Lab (Michael Sailor, nanotech)
    <ul>
      <li>His was the first lab I ever worked in. I’m grateful that he took me in
and exposed me to real life research work, even if I was not the brightest
bulb in the bunch…</li>
      <li>Our group had a lot of fun. We went kayaking at the end of the summer and
had a final presentation party at the professor’s house.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lanckriet Group (Gert Lanckriet, music)
    <ul>
      <li>Second lab I went to. Here, I tried to make some progress on learning
computer science. I quickly got stuck. This coincided with when I started
to spend time learning about Warren Buffett and investing.</li>
      <li>I am still grateful to Gert for taking me in and for showing me some of
the ropes of what development work looks like.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chen Lab (Clark Chen, oncological neurosurgeon)
    <ul>
      <li>Third lab I went to. This coincided with my attempt to make it in the
field of medicine as a young, scrappy 11th grader.</li>
      <li>Many thanks to Dr. Chen and Johnny and the rest of his team for teaching me
about cancer and what biology research is like.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scripps Young Leaders in Healthcare (Scripps Encinitas)
    <ul>
      <li>Ah, the days when I thought healthcare was a field I could make some
useful contribution towards.</li>
      <li>Although I never ended up having a strong love for healthcare and all
things medicine, this and the summer internship were great programs that
exposed me to all kinds of professions within medicine. Many thanks to
Dr. Andrew Accardi and the YLHC team for organizing something so amazing
for the local youth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chinese school (SDCA, Chinese Academy, held out of La Jolla Country Day)
    <ul>
      <li>I went to Chinese school through 7th grade. This was a good source of
weekend fun for me. My mom still keeps in touch with many of the other
moms who sent their kids to this school or taught at this school. I have
not talked to many of my former classmates since I left the school.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
