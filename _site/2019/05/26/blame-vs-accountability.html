  <h1>Blame vs. Accountability</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">May 26, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>A friend recently asked me what the difference was between blaming people
and holding them accountable. My answer: Nobody signs up for blame.</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>End of story.</p>

<p>eom</p>

<p>More seriously, nobody signs up to cause the department to lose $100m in
revenue in 2018. Nobody signs up to forget to turn off the car headlights and
drain the battery. Nobody signs up to forget to close the house windows on a
night when it rains and cause the house to get flooded.</p>

<p>Blame is a harmful and destructive emotional reaction to negative stressors.
It is natural to want to determine causality. It is natural to not want to
have to deal with negative consequences. It is not helpful to assign that
causality to agents that are independent of the result.</p>

<p>What is helpful is to hold people accountable for what they signed up for.
“Bob, you were responsible for helping us close that $10m deal with ABC
Plastics. What’s the status?” “Emily, we agreed on meeting at 6pm. We waited
until 6:30pm before you showed up. We really enjoy hanging out with you, but
this relationship is not going to work if you cannot show respect for our
time.” “Yeah, you apparently didn’t put one of the new cover sheets on your
TPS reports? … Did you see the memo about this?”</p>

<p>The objective of holding people accountable is to establish a social contract
of respect. The more you enforce accountability and your principles regarding
how you want to be treated, the more you will be respected. So…go out there
and make the world a better place.</p>
