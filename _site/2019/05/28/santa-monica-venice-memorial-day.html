  <h1>Memorial Day in Santa Monica and Venice</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">May 28, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>I spent Memorial Day in Santa Monica and Venice with a good friend. We left
Caltech around 10am and headed straight for Santa Monica pier. The past
couple of times I’ve come to the pier were around midnight, so I was
definitely surprised by the daytime activity. We immediately headed up from
sea level to the surface streets. We did a loop around the 3rd Street
Promenade then grabbed morning drinks at
<a href="https://espressocielo.com">Espresso Cielo</a>. I got a hot chocolate, and he got
some kind of cold latte. The cafe has a very nice vibe to it and has massive
pastries (croissant, cheese danish, etc). After drinks, we did another lap
and a half around the promenade (up to 4th then back down Santa Monica Blvd)
before stopping for lunch at <a href="https://cava.com">Cava</a>. I’d seen a bunch of
people at the Pasadena Cava on Lake but had not tried it, so I was ready to
be surprised. The food is expensive, at $12 for a bowl, but it’s super tasty.
Of course, the more you eat, the better the deal is. I saw some guy pack his
bowl almost twice as high as the container with vegetables and (unlimited)
toppings. I got falafel and chicken on a bed of arugula. Would highly
recommend if you’re into these kind of health food dishes.</p>

<p>After lunch, we walked Ocean Ave towards the Palisades Park. We saw a guy
flying a kite down at the water front and some plane dragging around a Pepsi
advertisement. We stopped once we got to 101 Ocean Avenue. We stopped to take a
gander at the ocean view from
<a href="http://www.toplacondos.com/Santa-Monica/101-Ocean/1">101 Ocean Avenue</a>
(condo residences) and watched some pickle ball players down on at sea level.
On our way back, we each snagged a Bird scooter and zipped down to Venice
Beach. I initially felt pretty unstable on the Bird scooter. The fear vanished
within a minute or two of using the scooter, though. We happily zoomed along
the bike lane, melding in seamlessly with car and pedestrian bike traffic.</p>

<p>We stopped zooming along once we got to Market Street x Pacific Avenue.
We ended our Bird rides then walked onto the famous Venice speedway.
Our first sight? A man trying to
<a href="../../../images/unicycle_venice.mov">ride a 7’ unicycle and juggle knives</a>.
Apparently that guy is out on the speedway every day. We walked along the
speedway for a while, simply soaking in the activity and vibrancy of the road.
We saw some <a href="../../../images/police_horses_venice.mov">police on horses</a>. We
also made it to <a href="../../../images/muscle_beach.mov">muscle beach</a>! Our last
sight before we headed off to see the canals was
<a href="../../../images/mural_venice.mov">this mural</a>.</p>

<p>The canals of Venice were originally built to drain the marshland. Now they
serve as a beautiful neighborhood in which to take some photos and peek into
other people’s expensive backyards. One lady was very upset that someone had
stolen her decorative bird feeder and posted a pointed sign saying that the
thief could “rot in hell”. The woman who presumably wrote the sign was
standing outside, watering her plants, so I would have brought some serious
fire and brimstone upon myself by taking a photo of it. Here is a picture
of the <a href="../../../images/venice_canal.png">canal</a>.</p>

<p>We were super thirsty at this point, having not taken water since lunch. We
decided to stop at the Thai restaurant at the south end of the canals for
some Thai iced tea. This was way too sweet for me, so I drank less than half
of it. After the drink, we went to check out the Venice skate park. This was
a super cool place. I really dig people who can throw their weight around on
a board. I’ve been tempted to buy a board since 5th grade, when I convinced
a friend to “teach” me how to ride. That was a scary experience that basically
was as aggressive as teaching someone to swim by pushing them into the deep
end. I’ve messed around with long boards since but have not pulled the trigger
for my own board yet.</p>

<p>Boards are cool, but you’ll really be surprised when you turn around and see
the people rollerskating in a coned off area behind the skate park. These
guys are brilliant. Somebody’s doing pirouettes in a corner. Another couple
is executing some tight choreography to whatever is blasting out of the boom
box. Some other guys are just messing around. Rollerskating is basically
ice skating on concrete.</p>

<p>At this point, I needed to find a quite place to take my
<a href="https://www.coffeechat.app">coffeechat.app</a> call. This is an app that matches
information seekers with information givers. Today, I was seeking information
on street design from Daniel, an Australian transport engineer. We had an
enjoyable 10 minute call about Jan Gehl and new urbanism and walkability in
cities. The app automatically connects you and your partner and automatically
cuts you off at 10 minutes, no warning. You can always schedule another call
or chat with them in the app, but perhaps 10 minutes was really enough time.</p>

<p>After the chat, we talked about travel. He wants to travel to all countries
in the world, going at least to the capital city and to one or two suburbs to
get food. I have technically been to quite a few countries in the world, but
I wouldn’t really say I’ve actually been there. I don’t know how to properly
travel, but I think I’m looking forward to a bunch of good years of traveling
with friends (once I find the right ones).</p>

<p>A side note. I think travelling between places is inhuman. Sitting in a metal
can that is dry and full of recirculated germ air for hours on end is
physically stressful. Time changes are physically stressful. Waiting in the
airport is physically stressful. All these things make travel hard, not to
mention how stressful it is to get a good itinerary set up and actually do
the things on the itinerary. But, if you’re a good control freak or if you’re
willing to listen to a good control freak, the itinerary part can be made much
easier. As to making the actual sitting in a metal can part easier, buy a
lounge pass, get first class seats, do all those things to make it more
palatable. It’s sad that affordable travel is so expensive, but you do what
you need to do to get the experiences you need to grow.</p>

<p>After chatting about travel, we decided to get dinner at Hotel Erwin, next to
Eggslut. Our first attempt to get to the restaurant led us to the
<a href="../../../images/rooftop_venice.png">rooftop bar</a>. I got a nice photo out of
it, but it wasn’t where we wanted to be. The bar was super popular that day,
too, so seats were exceedingly hard to come by. We headed back downstairs to
the actual restaurant and each had their OG burger. My friend has been
vegetarian his whole life, and this was his second time having a burger.
There were no surprises with his burger, but it’s not like I was expecting
anything. I don’t think switching to meat or switching to vegetarianism is
that life-changing. Food is still food. The changes are all biochemical and
internal.</p>

<p>I think I’m going to cut back on meat consumption. I need to eat more plants
and don’t need that much protein in my diet.</p>

<p>After dinner, we headed back home. It was a fun (not exhausting, actually) day
and we’re looking forward to round 2 before I graduate.</p>

<p>Yesterday was honestly the kind of day where I realize that I don’t actually
hate LA. I just hate Pasadena and its lack of variety and options and
suburban-ness. Pasadena is a bike-friendly city, but the lack of other activity
seriously dampens the bike-ability benefit. I love the craziness of Venice and
the beach vibe of Santa Monica because where else are you going to find such
great weather and such insane culture? San Diego beaches are way too laid
back. Most beaches in SD don’t have the kind of infrastructure Santa Monica
has. There are definitely no beaches that I can think of that have
Venice-style madness. SF Bay Area? Do they even have beaches? Maybe Santa Cruz
is their one saving grace. But I’m pretty sure Malibu has Santa Cruz handily
beat for surfing. I think LA is still the place to be if you love this blend
of individual expression and good weather and awesome food. You’ve just got to
live near the coast.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Questions and comments can go to my email.</p>
