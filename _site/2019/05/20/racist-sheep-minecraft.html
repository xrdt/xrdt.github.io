  <h1>I Had Racist Sheep in Minecraft</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">May 20, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>This story is old. It’s from my high school days, when I downloaded
<a href="https://mineshafter.info">Mineshafter</a> to see what the Minecraft craze was
all about. I am sad that I don’t have any pictures of my time in Mineshafter,
because it would really have lifted my spirits to see that house and farm I
created. It would also have made for a more compelling post.</p>

<p>The situation is that I had fenced in a bunch of sheep. They were next to
my utterly massive pens of cows and chickens. Despite my efforts to resize
the pens, the sheep kept wanting to escape. I don’t remember why I came upon
the idea to separate the sheep by color, but that was the solution. Black
sheep in a corner. Browns in another. Whites in the remaining space. No more
escaping sheep.</p>

<p>The escaping sheep phenomenon revived itself once I started breeding them.
A black and brown sheep could produce a brown. The black parent would not
want to be in the same pen as its brown child. I guess the parent-child bond
is not strong in Minecraft sheep.</p>

<p>I stopped playing Minecraft a while ago because it would make me super
motion sick. Around that time, I also found myself getting motion sick from
Twilight Princess on Wii. I would often try to push through the nausea, which
only resulted in my having to spend 30min - 1hr laying on the ground or couch,
waiting for my body to equilibrate. I haven’t played many video games since
high school.</p>

<p>I tried playing Mineshafter again a couple of months ago. The motion sickness
came on very quickly this time (&lt;20min). I immediately deleted the app. I
haven’t touched the game since, though I do want to recreate some version
of that very first world I inhabited, even if it did have racist sheep.</p>

<p>I guess I can only safely play games like
<a href="https://github.com/nullpomino/nullpomino">Tetris</a>.</p>
