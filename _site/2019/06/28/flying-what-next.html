  <h1>What's Next After Flying?</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 28, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>I took my first flying lesson in Seattle, during my summer internship with Microsoft. I did an 
intro lesson with Helicopters Northwest, I think…Cost me something like $100 for 45 minutes with 
an instructor. The experience was not super adrenaline-inducing, but I suppose it was enough to 
convince me to follow my friends and take ground school from <a href="http://aacit.org/">AACIT</a> president 
<a href="https://www.wingsbywerntz.com/">David Werntz</a>. Ground school cost me less than $200 for 10 weeks 
of instruction, covering, at a high level, pretty much all the chapters in the 
<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/">PHAK</a>. I took my first 
flight lesson, with David, during ground school, which ran in the fall / winter of 2018. I continued 
taking lessons with him until I graduated from Caltech on June 14, 2019, and accumulated over 60 
hours of flight. I have not yet received my license.</p>

<p>But I am now in a pit of despair about the whole “getting my pilot’s license” endeavor. If I want 
to get my PPL, I’d have to pass a written test and find a new club / instructor to finish things 
up with. That’s not a huge deal, it’s just requires an application of effort that I’m now 
questioning the value of. What do I do with a PPL? I’d like to get instrument rated, because that 
will expand the circumstances under which I can fly and make me a better pilot. I’d also like to 
get a commercial license, because that would serve as a good marker of my piloting ability. But 
what next? Assuming I get those licenses, I can only fly single engine planes that weigh less than 
12,500 lbs, carry fewer than 19 passengers, do not have retractable gear, are not tailwheel, and 
have engines with less than 200hp. Most people end up flying C172s or Piper Cherokees or 
Diamondstars or Cirrus’s. There’s nothing wrong with these planes, but I suppose there I have a 
sense of wanting to be in the big leagues, with the multi-engine jets or turboprops. I’m thinking 
Gulfstreams or Cessna Citations, etc. But it’s impractical to get there.</p>

<p>I’d need to get multi-engine and high-performance and type ratings for each fancy plane I want to 
fly. I’m not sure who provides that training and how much it costs. I don’t think these planes are 
cheap either, which means I’ll probably only be able to fly these planes if I work as a professional 
pilot for rich people who own corporations who can afford to expense these planes through the 
business (e.g. Panda Express, which stores its Cessna 680 at El Monte, where I have done most of my 
training so far).</p>

<p>At this point, this post is probably starting to sound very stupid and spoiled to most of you 
readers. I won’t deny the fatalistic, deterministic tone I’m taking. I’m still an idealistic dreamer 
who is trying to bite more than she can handle out of this world and her future. Life is all about 
determining priorities, tuning our individual inner compasses, and finding a good cozy place where 
we can either help the world unfold or watch it unfold. I’m leaning towards watching the world 
unfold, as that is the conclusion I have come to after every deep, philosphical series of thoughts 
I’ve had about what I should be with my time. But I’m afraid to take that step away from society, so 
I’ve resolved myself now to make a lot of money so I can have the freedom to sit back and relax and 
then make decisions about what role I want to play in the world. We’ll see how well that plan goes. 
My ambition is limitless, but my doubting mind is also relentless.</p>

<p>For now, I suppose I’ll work on getting my ppl…</p>
