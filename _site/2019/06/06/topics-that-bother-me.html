  <h1>Mental Bookmark June 2019: Topics that Bother Me Because I Don't Know Much About Them</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 6, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>The takeaways from this mental bookmark on my models of the world on June 6, 2019 are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I need to up my open-mindedness.</li>
  <li>I need to up my empathy.</li>
  <li>I have a lot to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>These topics are listed in order of how much they bother me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feminism
    <ul>
      <li>I have never been inclined to call myself a feminist because I have always felt like the 
movement just a bunch of women whining about how unfair the world is. I also feel like 
feminists are deliberately polarizing people who jump at the notion of any mention of vaguely 
controversial statements like “men and women are fundamentally different”.</li>
      <li>I don’t feel like I’ve been particularly subject to any gender based discrimination from 
people who’ve mattered. Those who have made stupid comments have basically been pushed to the 
sidelines of my life. I have made progress around those people asinine enough to think they 
could use petty comments to sabotage my attempts at success.</li>
      <li>Call me privileged and lucky all you want. I will not deny that I have had life pretty good so 
far. I will not deny that my opinion about #metoo and related feminist movements will change if 
I ever  am assaulted or seiously punished for not being male. But I feel like focusing on past 
mistakes and repeating the issue a million times is not going to resolve the issue. It just 
makes people feel uncomfortable and sad and wonder if they actually are being discriminated 
against. <a href="https://qz.com/1210845/the-subconscious-sexism-of-todays-feminist-movement/">This woman captures my feelings pretty well</a>.
I want to say that focusing on these issues detracts from progress, but 
<a href="https://twitter.com/paraschopra/status/1132963632906510336">progress is a nebulous concept</a>.</li>
      <li>There are so many ways to make mistakes but only so many ways to make things right. Focusing on 
the ways to do things right is simply more efficient.</li>
      <li>I am looking for people on Twitter to follow regarding feminism because I think it’s a topic 
that I should at least resolve my ignorance about. I still think my time is better spent on 
advancing my career or doing things that make me healthy, wealthy, and wise, but perhaps the 
common quips about being more open-minded are finally starting to drill their way through my 
skull.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Politics and Law
    <ul>
      <li>This is a whole grabbag of things but basically I’m interested in learning more about the 
structure of human societies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Racial Discrimination
    <ul>
      <li>My feelings on this are similar to my feelings on feminism. I have never experienced 
discrimination in a meaningful way, so I am not super sympathetic to any complaints on this 
front. I am also wary of any kind of Asian worshipping that comes out of the mouths of 
people like Munger (sorry, cannot find good link to any quotes, but you can look up his thoughts 
on BYD or Li Lu and Chinese people in general).</li>
      <li>What in the world is wokeness?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taxes and Personal Wealth Management
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t know how much I’ve spoken about this topic before, but I still think becoming 
financially independent is a priority. The best way to become financially independent while 
still living nicely is to invest. I’m still too dumb to take any serious interest in the stock 
market, so this objective will have to wait a bit.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, I need to learn how to properly budget and manage my post-college expenses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To repeat, the takeaways from this mental bookmark on my models of the world on June 6, 2019 are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I need to up my open-mindedness.</li>
  <li>I need to up my empathy.</li>
  <li>I have a lot to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ping me with suggestions on how to improve, books on how to expand my worldview, criticisms of my 
worldview.</p>
