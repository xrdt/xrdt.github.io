  <h1>Scattered Thoughts</h1>

<p>Here are some threads which I’ve been thinking about for a while but haven’t managed to consolidate 
into a blog post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When do you give up?
    <ul>
      <li>Bezos’ letter gives a pretty good start to this question by forcing you to distinctly describe 
what you are trying to achieve and to place a time table on your desired achievement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Never give up on a dream because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass 
anyway.</li>
  <li>Work on things that make you happy, regardless of what other people say about them.</li>
  <li>Figure out the price of success and pay it.</li>
  <li>Don’t get distracted by people who are playing a different game from you. (I have a post about 
this, but I somehow keep needing to remind myself of this.)</li>
  <li>How you live each day is how you live your life.</li>
  <li>Optimize for relationships. Choose the opportunities that will maximize your likelihood of 
building lasting, meaningful relationships (e.g. college) because people are everything.</li>
  <li>Optimize for happiness. The key criterion for living a good life is to want to be alive.</li>
  <li>I’m not afraid of the work. I’m more afraid of not having good people to work with.</li>
  <li>Next time you want to procrastinate, think hard about what you would be doing instead of what you 
should be doing.</li>
  <li>There is always hope. Even if there is no hope for you, there must be hope for someone else in 
the world.</li>
  <li>It’s always a good time to be alive.</li>
  <li>Don’t do work after sundown.</li>
  <li>YOu should build a place in your house that is used for relaxation and recuperation.</li>
</ul>
