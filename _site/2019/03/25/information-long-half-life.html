  <h1>Informattion with a Long Half Life</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 25, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>I recently came to a visceral realization of just how important the <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/03/half-life/">half 
life of knowledge</a> is. It hit me one 
day when I was daydreaming during a robotics class lecture on graph search 
algorithms. I realized that my grasp of basic algorithms had seriously 
declined since I’d stopped taking CS courses and doing software-heavy work. 
The realization drilled a brief burst of fear into my consciousness, as I 
realized that algorithms and most of the foundational, first-principles
type things I’d learned in my engineering courses were exactly those pieces 
of knowledge with long-half lives.</p>

<p>That idea of information, concepts, etc, with long half lives has been 
bugging me for a couple of weeks now (as have the things I posted in my 
<a href="https://xrdt.github.io/xrdt.github.io/2019/03/24/scattered-thoughts.html">last post</a>. 
Unfortunately, I’m slow to learn and slow to act, so it’s only now that I’ve
decided to ramp up my self-learning by studying textbooks. Why textbooks? 
Because they’re designed to be the most efficient way to accumulate 
knowledge.</p>

<p>What will I start with first? Perhaps a 
<a href="http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/planning/">robotics textbook</a> for now, since 
that is what I think is the most interesting path to pursue right now. 
In parallel, I need to study the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/">FAA Pilot’s Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>After that I might dabble into electronics and signal processing. After 
that, we’ll see where I’ve gone in life and what makes the most sense for 
me to look into. Besides, there’s an endless supply of textbooks on the 
internet to discover.</p>
