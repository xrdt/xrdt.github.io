<p>Yesterday evening, I went back to a new favorite of mine in Pasadena: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/miss-cheese-tea-cafe-pasadena-2">Miss Cheese Cafe</a>. This is a new place that opened just over a month 
ago, at the corner of Cordova and Arroyo Parkway.</p>

<p>A little history on this location. It’s been through 3 business changes since I matriculated 
at Caltech in 2015. First, it was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=flour+and+tea&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Flour and Tea</a>. Yes, the same Flour and Tea that is on Lake and 
serves Poke. Flour and Tea used to have both locations, but the Cordova location only had drinks and 
desserts like cookies and bread. Then it was <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/oh-my-pan-bakery-and-cafe-san-gabriel?osq=oh+my+pan">Oh My Pan</a> bakery. I remember going there once with a 
group of friends for the brick toast in the morning and leaving because they wouldn’t have it ready
until 11am. We ended up going to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/amara-chocolate-and-coffee-pasadena?osq=amara">Amara</a> for brunch, which was a fantastically delicious and filling 
choice. And now the location is Miss Cheese.</p>

<p>A quick look at Google Street View shows that Flour and Tea actually had the location for 
almost 4 years before it got handed over to Oh My Pan in 2016. Oh My Pan had the location for about 
3 years before it became Miss Cheese in Jan 2019. I don’t have a good sense for how stable food 
businesses should be, but this turnover feels fast. One of the major issues with the location is 
its poor visibility. It’s absolutely impossible to see until you’re right next to it when you’re 
heading north on Arroyo Parkway. The intersection of Cordova and Arroyo is a dead end into Public 
Storage. The sign is hard to see even if you’re going West along Cordova or south along Arroyo. 
It’s far away from all the other foods and shops on Colorado and Green Street. Overall, this 
corner is a very tucked away, nondescript couple of square meters that you’re likely to be intrigued 
by then forget immediately as you drive off to your more exciting location.</p>

<p>I don’t work for Miss Cheese, but I’d advise you to pay some more attention to this place, because 
their boba has the perfect consistency and their desserts are worth every dollar. The drinks 
are hit and miss, but I figure they’ll eventually get the flavor down pat.</p>

<p>The desserts. Miss Cheese makes a light, fluffy, delicious version of souffle that will melt on 
your tongue and delight your taste buds with every bite. The souffle comes in strawberry, plain, 
boba, and matcha. Each souffle is topped with a light, frothy, creamy sauce of unknown but 
irresistible ingredients. This is what I got the first time I went and is what I’ve been taking 
all my friends here for. The other dessert they have is the mille crepe cake that 
<a href="https://www.ladym.com/">Lady M</a> has made famous. The crepe cake comes in Oreo, matcha, and plain.
I tried the Oreo last night. The Oreo creme in between the crepe layers was a bit light for my 
tastes, but the texture of the cake was nice and soft. Lady M’s crepe cakes have thinner layers, 
but the thickness does not at all detract from the flavor.</p>

<p>Both the souffles and crepe cakes are made fresh in house. That is why you may end up waiting 20 - 
30 min for your perfect, buoyant, glistening souffles to come out of the kitchen. The crepe cakes 
are made in the morning then stored in the fridge, so the wait time will be maybe 5 min at most.</p>

<p>Miss Cheese has other desserts, like Japanese cheesecake and Taiyaki, which I’ll have to try the 
next time I go. I almost forgot to mention that all their foods are exceedingly Instagram worthy.</p>

<p>Now the drinks. The one drink I’ve been most satisfied with from Miss Cheese is the sesame drink. 
I <em>love</em> black sesame. Give me all the black sesame 湯圓，麻吉，drinks, etc. in the world. Miss 
Cheese’s black sesame drink comes with black sesame cheese foam, which is to die for. It has a 
wonderfully rich sesame flavor and isn’t overwhelmingly oily, like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=tancha&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">嘆茶’s</a> cheese foam. The liquid 
is ok, but not quite full-bodied enough for me. Maybe it’s because I ordered half sweet. I’ve 
also tried their tiramisu ceylon tea. Ceylon tea is the base for thai tea. The tiramisu foam has 
too much cocoa flavor for me. It didn’t really taste like tiramisu. The drink was also too bitter 
for my taste. I ended up tossing it after drinking 30% of the liquid.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a cute dessert place to chill at in Pasadena, Miss Cheese is not a bad option. 
They have wonderful souffles and crepe cakes to keep your taste buds busy. Don’t forget to add 
their perfectly cooked boba to your drinks! Just remember that it’s in a hard to spot location, so 
don’t lose patience if you don’t quite see it as you’re approaching the corner of Cordova and 
Arroyo Parkway.</p>
