  <h1>Food Journal, March 17 2019</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 17, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />

<p>Today I want to tell everybody about <em>the best ramen in Pasadena</em>, ube desserts
at Cafe 86, and A Ri Rang Tofu House. (I end up talking about more places,
but you’ll have to read on to know which ones.)</p>

<p>Two days ago, I visited <a href="http://chibiscus.com">Again Cafe x Chibiscus Ramen</a>
for the 3rd time in the past month. I keep coming back to this place
because their <a href="http://chibiscus.com/again-caf-menu">“hand-craft, low-fat, high-protein, hearty, 20-hour bone marrow
&amp; vegetable broth”</a> is just that bloody
amazing. I first stumbled upon this place two years ago, when I was still in
a “ramen is the best food let’s eat it every day” phase. That’s why there’s
so many ramen places on my
<a href="https://xrdt.github.io/useful_links.html">Things in LA to Try Map</a>.
I didn’t think very highly of this place on my first trip. I ordered what I
considered, at the time, to be the pinnacle of ramen varieties: hakata style
tonkotsu ramen. My friend ordered the same, with some additional veggies and
<em>an egg</em>. Why is it important to highlight the egg? Well, at that time, the
menu was not very well organized. It was not clear that an egg was already
included in the ramen so my friend ended up with two whole hard-boiled eggs
in her soup. Needless to say, she left with a strange impression of the place.
The ramen that day was average. It couldn’t beat Ramen Tatsunoya just a bit
north.</p>

<p>If I thought so highly of Tatsunoya, why did I go back to Chibiscus? I went
back because the line at Tatsunoya was too long. My friends and I circled
around in Old Pas for a bit before finally resigning ourselves to go to
Chibiscus. I was pleasantly surprised by the new menu. They added a bunch
more ramen varieties, upgraded the documentation, came up with some new
rice dishes and small plates, and got some desserts and drinks on the list.</p>

<p>I ordered tonkotsu and we got some spam musubi for the table. The ramen was
delightful. It was nice and hot, the noodles al dente, the chashu tender and
flavorful, and the toppings nicely portioned. The spam musubi was a bit
small and the seaweed a bit tough but the flavor was definitely on point.
We ended the evening with chibi brick toast. The chibi brick toast, which
comes with chocolate sauce, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream,
assorted fruits, and butter, was the best brick toast I’ve ever had. The
toast was crisp on top but exceedingly fluffy inside. It was not too sweet and
just a bit salty from the butter on the toast. The fruits were fresh and the
portion was just perfect for the three of us with stomachs full of ramen.</p>

<p>That experience at Chibiscus was lovely. I didn’t leave feeling like my
stomach had too much acid in it (like I normally do after eating Tatsunoya)
and I was so so delighted with the brick toast.</p>

<p>I went back maybe a week later, with another friend. The experience was just
as good, though we only got dessert this time.</p>

<p>The third visit this month was two days ago, on Friday the 15th. The friend
I was going with was <em>very</em> hungry. She ordered tonkotsu and I decided to
break my routine and go for the spicy miso. She melted the moment she got
some of the broth on her tongue. She devoured her bowl and almost asked for
more noodles. She said that she normally can’t finish her food. This was a
sure sign that this place would be going on her list of places to revisit.
The spicy miso didn’t taste too much different from the tonkotsu. The broth
is nice and creamy and just a tad more spicy than I expected. It’s a very oily
spice, one that attacks your throat but that can be quickly cooled with a swig
of cool water. The onsen egg was expertly cooked to the right consistency.
My only suggestion would be to marinate the eggs in soy sauce or something
similar. We ended the evening with an order of takoyaki, perhaps my least
favorite Japanese food. Chibiscus’ takoyaki comes out piping hot, so be
sure to bite carefully and blow generously before shoving the smooth, delicate
batter into your mouth. The tako is sparse, but I suppose that’s how things are
done around here.</p>

<p>After this third adventure to Chibiscus, we went to
<a href="http://www.cafe-86.com">Cafe 86</a>, which is just up the alley behind 85 C.
Cafe 86 is a shop that specializes in ube, a purple yam popular in
Filipino cuisine. We got there on a day where the truffles are the special.
Friday and Saturday are the days to snag those puppies. She ordered three,
ate one immediately, and saved the other two for breakfast. I ordered four
truffles, one cupcake, and one bundt cake. The truffles are definitely
the thing to go for. These truffles aren’t made of chocolate, so hold your
tongues back if you were thinking of slathering all over some tannins. These
truffles are cake truffles, which means they’re made of a rich, fattening
mixture of cake crumbs, frosting, candy melts, and of course the secret
ingredient ube. Think cake pops but larger, if you’ve had those. The cake pops
are $2.25 a piece, but closer to $2.5 if you include the famous American
sales tax that insidiously gets added to your bill in every state except
Oregon. These truffles are so creamy, so decadent, so fattening, but not so
sweet, you really would do well to serve them at your next afternoon tea.
It’s hard for me to describe just how amazing these things are; you’ll have
to come to Old Pas and get one for yourself. The other desserts were ok. The
cupcake wasn’t much to speak of. The bundt cake has lots of chunks of ube
in it, if you want to taste more of that. It tastes kind of like taro,
especially taro pastes you’ll find in Chinese bakeries. But forget those.
Go on Fri or Sat, pick up some truffles, and thank me later.</p>

<p>What’s next? A Ri Rang Tofu House. I went here today with a bunch of
classmates from Ruddock House. It’s a pretty plain Korean restaurant that
serves everything from tofu soups to bibimbap to bulgolgi on steaming cast
iron plates to chap chae, etc. Why did I not link this place? I didn’t think
it was that good. The combos are not bad price wise, but the flavors are
lacking. You get a lot of banchan, with unlimited refills, so definitely
chow those down if you can. The rice is mediocre, the bibimbap doesn’t come
with enough meat and you have to pay $2 extra for the hot stone bowl. The
kimchi isn’t spicy enough, the broccoli banchan was undercooked, etc. I’d give
it a 3 stars. It’s not nearly as good as the
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/tofu-house-san-diego">Tofu House on Convoy</a>, in
San Diego.</p>

<p>Anything else? Sure, I can talk about Leberry Bakery, which is a new
vegan donut and happy hour with desserts shop in Old Pas. I ordered two
donuts from them last time, and both were average. Not sure if I’ll go back,
honestly, which is why I didn’t link. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Appendix:
While I was writing this, I figured I’d circle back and write about a couple
of other places in Old Pas I figure people should know about.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sohgrillhouse.com">Soh Grill House</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a kbbq place up next to Wheat Shop (see below). The biggest
  impression I had about this place was that the tables were to wide
  that my party had difficult hearing people from across the table. They
  had good service that day because the main server was showing a trainee
  how to serve customers. We got a lot of attention on our meats that
  day. The food was average tasting and probably somewhat expensive (I
  wasn’t paying that day). They do have some pretty unique sorbet desserts.
  They cut open lemons and peaches and fill them with lemon or peach sorbet,
  respectively. It’s a cool concept and the flavor isn’t bad. Overall, a
  3.5 star restaurant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://bonekettle.com">Bone Kettle</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an uber hyped “we cook soup with bones” (like how the ****
  else do you cook soup) Indonesian place in Old Pas. The ambience is
  nice and fancy but the food is underflavored. I ordered a quite
  expensive oxtail + noodles bowl (you can get it cheaper at
  [Borneo]).(https://www.yelp.com/biz/borneo-kalimantan-cuisine-alhambra-2)
  The broth tasted like nothing special. I was hoping for more flavor,
  for more punch. The oxtail was pretty tender, but I still think Borneo
  makes their even more “fall off the bone”. The uber expensive fancy
  organic carrots and onions and other vegetables were a nice touch
  and fit the scene, but I was underwhelmed by the rest so they didn’t
  make me feel any better at the time. The noodles were thin and tasty.
  Overall, I think I’m salty about this place not being salty or
  exotically flavored enough, like Borneo is. I won’t say it should be
  off your list, but unless it’s your special “spend money on food”
  day or you’re really craving soup or you just want somewhere fancy
  to go, I would recommend you look to Borneo for more crazy Indonesian
  flavors and comfort food. Also, if you do plan to go, try to make a
  reservation beforehand. It’ll save you something like a 30 min wait.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wheatshops.com">Wheat Shop</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Yeah, the website is ugly, but the cream puffs are worth every dollar.
  The cream puffs come in chocolate, vanilla, matcha, and hazelnut. They
  don’t last very long, so the sooner you go from paying to shoving them
  (delicately) in your mouth, the more you will agree with my assessment
  of just how amazing they are. I haven’t tried the other food they sell,
  but the cream puffs are absoutely the kind of oversized dessert you want
  to get for yourself when you’re feeling down and want that food comfort.
  So, actually, why are the cream puffs that good? The outside is
  delightfully crispy and the inside has very fresh tasting cream. It’s not
  too sweet, and the outer layer will practically dissolve on your tongue
  as you bite into it.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Just one last shout out to Caltech’s pasty chef(s), who produce some amazing
things like guava + cheese pastries, apple tarts, almond croissants, chocolate
tarts, etc. every day. Stop by Hameetman for one of our flaky, buttery, bad
for your health but irresistibly delicious taste experiences.</p>
