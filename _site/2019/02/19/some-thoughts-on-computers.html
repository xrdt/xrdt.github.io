  <h1>Some Thoughts on Computers</h1>

    <p>Physical Abstractions</p>

    <p>The desktop is an abstraction of your physical desktop. The file system
 abstracts your file cabinet. The mouse button sometimes looks like a
 hand because it is supposed to represent your physical hand grabbing
 an object.</p>

    <p>The internet is just one large computer. It’s a big computer made up of
 lots of smaller computers. Google and other search engines search through
 the Internet file system. Web addresses are like file paths on your local
 computer; they represent the sequence of nested file folders you have to
 open to get to your desired document. Your web browser is like your
 secretary, keeping track of where you’ve been and how you got there. The
 web browser also formats files as nicely as it can. Formatting can be
 hard, because sometimes files are in strange formats. When the Internet
 is slow, think about how some people are slow to deliver on promises or
 respond to your messages. This just means that subcomputer is
 underpowered. More people want to talk to it than it can talk to at one
 time.</p>

    <p>The internet is like an amusement park. You have to pay an entrance fee to
 an Internet Service Provider to get in. Once you’re in, they will watch
 and record everything that you do. This amusement park never closes and
 pretty much has no rules, so you have to be careful to protect yourself.
 The <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/tools">EFF</a> is an organization that wants
 to help protect you. You can download some of their protective tools from
 the link I attached.</p>

    <p>There is more to the internet and computers, like online advertising and
 hardware, but those leak beyond the physical abstractions. Feel free to
 use the internet to learn more about those <a href="https://wikipedia.org">things</a>.</p>

    <p>Copy-Paste-Cut</p>

    <p>This is a computer only tool that is just brilliant. You want to move a
 whole paragraph of text you just wrote on your word processor? Swoosh,
 into your register it goes. You like what you just wrote? Well,
 congratulations, now you have a mini-propaganda horn! Go ahead and paste
 those few pieces of text everywhere with the simple keyboard shortcut</p>
    <CTRL>-V (or Cmd-V). Unfortunately, most of us live with only one
 copy register. But you can certainly upgrade on
 [Mac](https://www.alfredapp.com) and ~sort of~ on
 [Windows](https://zapier.com/blog/best-clipboard-managers/) to get more
 registers. Who wouldn't want more propaganda horns? Toot! Toot!
