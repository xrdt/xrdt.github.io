  <h1>Why Write a Blog</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">February 19, 2019</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>I recently had a rather brazen, obnoxious thought about why I should share
my thoughts, especially those thoughts that emerge suddenly and seem just
absolutely brilliant in the moment. The thought went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not done talking. I want you to know the full extent of my intellectual
capacity, of my smartness, so I’m going to tell you all the profound things
that are currently on my mind, even if they end up being not profound or
downright stupid a few minutes later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that reflects on how I run this blog. Every so often, I’ll have what
seems to be a profound thought about the universe. Sometimes, that profound
thought will trigger enough subsequent thinking and substance that I will
consider writing a post about it. Normally, if the post doesn’t get finished
on that first wave of inspiration, it will sit as an unfinished draft, waiting
for me to figure out what exactly was so worthwhile about those loose threads
of thought. As a result, most of what I write on this blog probably ends up
being mediocre, with a very small half-life. That result is ok, in the sense
that this blog can just be a bucket of my thoughts. It will be a public
repository of my mental development over the years. Likely some people will
take offense with the public nature of the blog. Why risk exposing dangerous,
potentially black-mail or lawsuit worthy thoughts onto the internet, where
anybody and anything can take advantage of it? The obscurity that I currently
enjoy may last a long time. It may end very soon.</p>

<p>I do this is because I like it. I like the idea of having other people
combing through my thinking. I like the idea that I have good thoughts,
thoughts that galvanize, upset, stimulate other people. I like the idea of
being on the internet, of being discoverable, of being latent. I like writing.</p>

<p>There it is. When I don’t write, I have nothing profound to say. When I do
write, I’ve got an itch to scratch, an itch that says I have something
profound to say, something that the world hasn’t considered in a good enough
way before, something that reinforces my belief in my intellect.</p>
