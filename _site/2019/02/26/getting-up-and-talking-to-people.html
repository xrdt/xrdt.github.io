  <h1>Getting up and Talking to People</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">February 26, 2019</h3>

<p>There are some days when digital communication pisses me off to planes higher
than it should be able to excite me to. These are the days when people are
trying to schedule a time to meet in person but people are too busy
multi-tasking or trying to ghost each other that the time never gets set and
the meeting doesn’t happen. I think these days are worse than those when
people show up late or are no-shows and any attempt to contact them prior to or
around the preset meeting time meet with delivered but unreads. I think these
days are also worse than those when you get ghosted before a plan gets set.
I think these are worse than the days when you don’t talk to a single person
in person.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point in bringing up the first, worst kind of digital communication
mishap is that I think there’s so much lost value in just getting up off your
() and talking to that person. This is especially true when you live in a
college dorm (like I do~) or if you’re in an office with that person. Even
if the conversation only takes 5 minutes, the experience is almost always
better in person. There’s something about how free form meeting in person
tends to be, how you could say almost anything when you’re sharing the
same airspace, how easily that 5 minutes could turn into an hour that makes
the experience more magical. Besides, I think getting disturbed by the
occasional knock on the door is much more friendly than being disturbed by
the incessant buzzing of my phone in my pocket or the infinite little
pings of Slack or FB notifications.</p>

<p>All it takes is a five minute walk to find the people you care about. All
it takes is a bit of disregard for notions of efficiency and productivity and
“but I could just text them” laziness that are all too common in the modern
lexicon. Spend time, in person, with the people who matter to you. Those are
the interactions that really count.</p>
