  <h1>Passive Income Strategies</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">January 21, 2019</h3>

  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />

<p>One of my goals for this year, perhaps before I graduate in June, is to set
up a passive income strategy generating $500/month. I think $500/month is
going to be a fairly tough goal, based on what little I’ve seen of other
people’s reported passive strategies. But $500/month ($6k/year) is large
enough that it actually feels productive.</p>

<p>Below are a couple of the ideas I’ve had:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selling high margin products through <a href="https://www.junglescout.com">Amazon FBA</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I have a friend who makes &gt; $100k selling on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=&amp;isCBA=&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;orderID=&amp;seller=A1N2CNKL5RY2LG&amp;tab=&amp;vasStoreID=">Amazon</a> and
<a href="https://www.efficientliving.com">his own website</a>. It takes him, as he
says, maybe an hour a week packing boxes in his underwear.</li>
      <li>The struggle here is finding the right product(s). Given my previous,
lackadaisical attitude towards market research of any form, I’m not sure
how well I’ll succeed in doing the FBA research.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Franchising
    <ul>
      <li>This seems to require to require far too much initial, in-person, effort
to be really attractive for me. I guess, once it’s set up right, with
you just taking a cut of profits while other people run the show, it can
work out nicely.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ads
    <ul>
      <li>Sure, ads are easy to add to anything. I could add ads to this website
with fairly low effort. But do I really want to have a bunch of clickbait
or ugly ads on this beautiful, hand-crafted website? No, I don’t want to
waste your people’s time with something so crude.</li>
      <li>One other way to get ad revenue is through YouTube. I once debated the
idea of starting a channel where every day, a new one-minute video
of me counting 10 numbers would be posted. For example, Mondays would be
English, Tuesdays Russian, Wednesdays Chinese, Thursdays review English,
etc. Each week, we would advance another 10 numbers, so by the end of
the year, we’d have counted to 500. It’s not much effort on my part,
but I also don’t think it’s particularly effective as a YouTube income
producer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Affiliate Marketing
    <ul>
      <li>I played the role of salesman for Kanberra Gel two summers ago. I would
give samples to Uber drivers, in the hopes that they would prefer our
all-natural, tea tree oil air cleaner over the tree-shaped, soap-smelling
air fresheners they normally used. It was kind of fun, kind of
nerve-wracking, mostly exhausting. I have since tried to avoid any kind
of salesman or campus ambassador positions, because I don’t think those
roles really fulfill me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Selling designs (t-shirts, stickers, etc)
    <ul>
      <li>This could turn out nice, but I think the expected value here is very low.
It’s likely a volume game, and I’ve already said I don’t really want to
work on marketing or selling my stuff, so that pretty much means I’m
going to suffer low-volume, low-revenue if I pursue this idea.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Investing (stock market, real estate)
    <ul>
      <li>This is probably the most obvious of the passive income strategies.
I used to be very invested (haha) in investing but eventually acknowledged
the truth that I really didn’t enjoy thinking about the stock market and
gave up. Maybe one day, I’ll take it up again.</li>
      <li>I think real estate investing has a limitation of requiring relatively
high starting capital base, so I may not be able to really pursue it for
some time. More on real estate and owning land later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rental property
    <ul>
      <li>The most classic rental property is to rent out house space, through
AirBnB or Craigslist. But I think people should consider renting out
every other piece of property they own. For example, car sharing through
Turo. Other forms of rental could be renting out kitchen equipment, like
a KitchenAid standmixer, or blender for some hourly rate. What about
renting out your bike, scooter, backyard, front yard, tool bag, etc?
As a college student who doesn’t have much space or frequent need for
some of the above things, I find the idea of rental household equipment
pretty valuable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Royalties
    <ul>
      <li>Here is where I begin thinking about monetizing my ideas more than
physical manifestations of my ideas. The most obvious royalty-based
products are music and books. Maybe one day I’ll have enough wisdom to
put in a book and share with others.</li>
      <li><a href="https://stratechery.com">Stratechery</a> isn’t royalty-based, but it’s
a neat way to monetize all those smarts Ben Thompson’s got in his head.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vending Machine
    <ul>
      <li>I think this is largely a real estate game. You have to find the places
with good traffic with hungry, anxious, bored, etc people with no other
options. You have to make sure the rate of vandalism is low enough that
you aren’t going to lose sleep over broken front panels or stolen goods.
But, if you have the capital and connections to acquire a machine and
get it somewhere good, this probably isn’t a bad passive strategy.
You could probably pay someone to collect the money for you at some
point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Subscription) Software
    <ul>
      <li>I’m thinking stuff like <a href="http://freedom.to">Freedom</a>, or
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/time-out-break-reminders/id402592703?mt=12">TimeOut</a>. I feel like this strategy is more frontloaded than some of the
above, but it has a faster decaying tail than something like, investing,
or real estate, or rentals, maybe…I don’t have data to back this up,
only anecdotal considerations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Passive income doesn’t have to be 5 min each day for 100K a
year. As long as the hourly rate is above some minimum, like $500/hr, and
the yearly commitment is below some maximum, like 200 hours (10% of
40hr/week yearly work rate), your strategy could be considered passive income.
With that definition, perhaps there are even some side jobs that would qualify
as passive income. For example, giving talks, or occasional consulting jobs.</p>

<p>My goal with this passive income endeavor is to FIRE (Financial Independence
Retire Early). Sure, with a software developer’s income, it’s “easy” to achieve
FIRE (where’s the sarcasm text modifier), but the easiness is still modulated
by the size of the capital base you need to accumulate. I’ll need to do the
calculations to figure out how much money I actually need to be happy going
forward.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that I would talk about real estate later. Now’s that later.
I also mentioned in my previous post that I would talk about things people
find repeated value in. This idea is currently very rough, but I was thinking
about how people can repeatedly enjoy using a piece of land yesterday. For
example, think about the repeated value of a park, a mall, a basketball court,
a soccer field, your backyard, a pool, etc. I guess I want whatever I create
as a passive income generator to be reusable. If it’s subscription software,
I want people to continuously use it. I want people to continuously seek out
my rental property. I want people to continuously look for my t-shirt
designs. I want people to frequent my franchise. If it’s investing, …, I
suppose I want whatever I invest in to have that repeated value quality to it.</p>

<p>Maybe the above paragraph is a bit stupid, because everything, from shoes, to
your desk, to your clothes, has repeated value. Things get consumed and need
to be replaced all the time. That’s just part of the cycle of life. We
fight hard, work hard, do things every day because flow and happiness are
elusive. We need to go out and search, to seek our flow each and every day.
Maybe that’s what I was thinking about yesterday, over that mediocre bowl
of ramen.</p>
