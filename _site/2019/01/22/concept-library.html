  <h1>Conceptual Library Setup</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">January 22, 2019</h3>

<p>I just had a strange idea
for a personal library setup. This is a <em>physical</em> personal library, mind you,
because the whole point is to have the visitor or owner be able to wander
through and glean something meaningful from the physical arrangement.</p>

<p>Back to the main point. The shelves should be mobile. The books should be
placed in chronological order of when they were last read. I originally
thought they should be placed where they were bought, because that would
allow one to immediately see what kind of knowledge acquisition phase the
reader was going through at that time. This would make trends in mental
development of the reader more obvious. But dates can be inscribed on
the inside of the book, so it’s probably more useful to organize the books
based on chronological order of reading. Each read, just like each checkout,
gets a stamp on a card inside the book, or in a database, so it’s easy to know
how often the book gets read by that person. It reflects, again, on the
reader’s mental development and state. This book arrangement means that books
will accumulate in some direction, emptying shelves at the end. To maintain
spatial order, you should move the shelves back, which is why I suggested
mobile shelves.</p>

<p>Now that I’m thinking about it more, it’s probably best to integrate
some automated book retrieval system. I love the idea of having a physical
space to walk around and read in, so you’ll still need to allocate space.
What changes now, is that instead of having physical book shelves to browse,
you’ll have digital panels that will show you the real-time, always-up-to-date
arrangement of books in the collection. Touch screens can be incorporated
so people can preview the books, see book reviews, see reading history,
etc. People who want to checkout a book can just tap “checkout” and have a
robot arm deliver it to a pickup section. There is still a space limitation
here, in the sense that if you want to maintain the same magnification of the
books on your digital screen, you will have to continually buy new screens and
allocate more space. You could either shrink the digital shelf magnification
or move to a infinite scroll type shelf.</p>

<p>At this point, unless someone has a real desire for what I’ve described, this
idea will remain the product of Tuesday morning idle speculation.</p>
