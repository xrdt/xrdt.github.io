  <h1>Three Factors Which Determine Where I Want to Work</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">August 26, 2018</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>People, Projects, Growth.</p>

<p>For now, those are the three factors I want to optimize for in my search for
a career.</p>

<p><strong>People (60%)</strong>: People are the most important determining factor of how much you
enjoy an experience. Cleaning dog poop in 100% humidity and over 100 deg
Fahrenheit weather can be enjoyable if you have the right people to do it with.
People donâ€™t have loyalty to their companies. They have loyalty to their
coworkers.</p>

<p>I want to work with people who are passionate about something. I want to work
with people who do cool things in the evenings and on the weekends and have
interesting stories or learnings to share at our daily lunches. I want people
who are creators, who are galvanized by life. I want to be inspired by those
people and to inspire them.</p>

<p>I also want to note the importance of good manangement. Good management should
be able to motivate and direct its subordinates. Good management should look
to promote or move around its subordinates to places where they are most happy
and where they will make the most impact. Good management helps make things
work properly.</p>

<p><strong>Growth (30%)</strong>: I want to work on technologies that are at the frontier of
our understanding. These technologies are like our dreams. We have a small
glimpse of them. We barely know what they look like or what they do, but we
can see the possibility of getting to the destination from our current
position.</p>

<p>Right now, some technologies that I think fit this description are VR/AR,
ML/AI research, robotics, carbon removal, and the future of transporation.</p>

<p>Growth also refers to company growth and career trajectory. The company should
have ambitions beyond maintaining a legacy version of its cash cow. The
company should always be looking to innovate and research fundamental insights
for a world decades into the future. The measure of company success should be
its impact on society, or how many more problems were solved by having this
company around than by not having this company around.</p>

<p><strong>Projects (10%)</strong>: What I am working on is nowhere near as important as the
experience of working on it. The experience, I think, can be defined by the
growth and people involved.</p>

<p>If you think you have a case for fulfilling these three categories for me,
please send me an email.</p>
