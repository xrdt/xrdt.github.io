  <h1>Everybody Has Ideas</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">July 1, 2018</h3>

<p>I think everybody has ideas. You all have ideas for great startups or projects
or how to make new friends or an ideal summer vacation in Europe. The problem
most people face is that they spend too much time filtering their ideas
for quality. We all think our idea for self-stirring coffee cups (taken from
Reddit) is great until we find that someone else has developed and sold
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kurukurunabe-Self-stirring-Pot-Only-Japan/dp/B00AGIRUKY">such a product</a>. We all think our dream to become president and fix social
welfare is great until someone tells us just how hard it is to become a
candidate. We all think our fancy startup idea to design boats that paddle
themselves is beyond genius (thank you again, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/239gug/what_genius_ideas_have_you_had_which_turned_out/">Reddit</a>)
until we find out that we just thought of technology that has been sitting in
our plain sight (motorized boats).</p>

<p>So, with all these disappointments under our belt, by the time we have the
skill or the money to pursue some of our genius ideas, we’ve lost most of the
ambition needed to make them happen. But that’s not the end of this story.
You can turn yourself into an Idea Machine again. You can reinspire yourself
and turn around your life. The key is to realize that coming up with ideas
is a skill that can be built with practice. All you have to do is to start
coming up with ideas. Just let them flow. Write down all your ideas, even the
ones you think not even your grandmother who loves you and all your
perfections would be able to give a thumbs up to. I’d recommend you hit at
least 10 ideas each day. Eventually, you will accumulate so many ideas that
you’ll want to start acting upon some of them! The moment you start acting on
your ideas is the moment your life takes another step towards a higher plane
of living.</p>

<p>After about 6 months of coming up with ideas, you’ll have exercised your
idea muscle to the point where you can claim yourself to be an Idea Machine.
At this point, you should have confidence in the quality of your ideas and
can start sharing them with others. Don’t by shy about sharing your ideas.
The more you share with others, the more diversity of thought you uncover and
the greater the evolutionary ascendance your ideas can achieve. Besides,
there’s no <a href="sanctity-ideas.html">sanctity of ideas</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t wait, get started now! Pull out a piece of paper, a napkin, a note card,
whatever, and start churning out those ideas!</p>
