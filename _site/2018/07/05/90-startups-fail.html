  <h1>90% Failure</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">July 5, 2018</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>Have you heard this statistic before: “90% of startups fail (in their first
year, in the first x years, etc.)”?</p>

<p>Have you heard <em>these</em> statistics before:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“90% of people give up on their New Year’s Resolution by the end of X month”</li>
  <li>“90% of people give up on their diet / exercise regimen by x weeks”</li>
  <li>“90% of scientific research is wrong or doesn’t support the hypothesis”</li>
  <li>“90% of pretty much everything goes wrong”</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s with the extreme focus on startups? Why not focus on the real problem
here, which is … “dealing with humans”? The reason so many of our
well-intentioned “turn around lives” ventures or ideas fail is because we
let them fail. We gave ourselves an extra cheat day. We procrastinated too
many days (or weeks, or months…) in a row. We ignored the warning signals
and smart advice of our peers and mentors. We gave up.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, the reason these statistic are as bad as they are is because
everybody gives up. That’s why it’s so hard to become exceptional at anything.
That’s why there are only so many people in the world who are recognized
for their crafts. That’s why you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps
and start to fight back against the Resistance! You need to realize that
procrastination and rationalization and sweets are all just horrible,
horrible delaying tactics. They’re keeping you from building the life you
want to live.</p>

<p>Whether or not you want to stand up to the Resistance (and understand what
the Resistance is), take deep breath,
follow <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530849238&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=war+of+art&amp;dpID=41hM%252BLf2pLL&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch">this link</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530849249&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=steal+like+an+artist">this link</a>,
and click BUY on both items. Wait until you get the books devour the books in
one day, take a day or two of a breather, then sink yourself into the books.
Those two books, I promise you, will help get you out of whatever hole you’re
currently in.</p>
