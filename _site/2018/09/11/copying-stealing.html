  <h1>Copying, Stealing</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 11, 2018</h3>

<p>There was some controversy in tech media several years back about Samsung
copying Apple’s iPhone designs.</p>

<p>There used to be strong controvery about China copying the US.</p>

<p>There has always been controversy in schools about students copying each
others’ work.</p>

<p>Samsung has since outpaced Apple on smartphone designs (and many other things)
and Apple now seems to be following Samsung’s lead on some phone design
features (bigger screen is the main feature I was thinking about). Samsung is
leading in OLED and general consumer electronics and Apple doesn’t seem to
have the power to wow its customers anymore. China is developing very quickly
and has estbalished itself as a tech superpower. The US now looks to China as
a serious security and technological threat. Chinese students used to want to
stay in the US after graduation. Now they look more towards opportunities in
China. Cheating in school will always be undesirable behavior. I put that
statement there because I feel there is something more wholesome about
creating lists of three than about creating lists of other numbers.</p>

<p>The key insight here is that China and Samsung were not mindlessly copying.
They were studying. They were standing upon the shoulders of a giant in
government and technology and a giant in consumer products and design and
leveraging the learnings of each group to accelerate their development.</p>

<p>Productivity, output, impact, these are all words trying to get at the same
idea of a central measure of usefulness of a venture. The more productive you
are, the more valuable you will become to society. So if you need to
“steal” and “copy” your way through your journey to greatness, so be it. Just
make sure you’re learnings will be able to support you when you exceed
those you are studying from and make a break for your dreams.</p>
