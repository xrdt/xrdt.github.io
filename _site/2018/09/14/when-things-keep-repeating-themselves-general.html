  <h1>When Things Keep Repeating Themselves (General)</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 14, 2018</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>A broken record that keeps repeating itself is using the repetition as a
signal that something is wrong. People who keep repeating themselves to you
are signaling that they don’t feel they are being heard. Repeatedly failing
a class signals that you haven’t actually learned any more from the subsequent
iterations than you did on the first. Walking down the same path in a maze
signals that you are lost and that no, you shouldn’t have made a left at that
intersection. When your life keeps repeating itself, it’s a signal that you
are neglecting something important, something critical to your happiness and
fulfillment and productivity.</p>

<p>What are examples of your life repeating itself? Setting the same resolution
every year on Jan 1 and never achieving it. Telling yourself to quit your job
and open that bake shop you’ve always wanted to have every time your manager
says you’re not in line for promotion. Saying you’ll start going to gym, start
getting fit, every time you see that gym membership fee on your monthly
credit card statement. When you keep feeling like you’re lost in life and you
keep hearing the same advice on how to get unlost.</p>

<p>When things keep repeating themselves, it’s time for you to slow down. You
need to figure out why these things keep happening to you and why you keep
ignoring their messages. Are you better off for ignoring them? Then move on
and stop trying to repeat things fruitlessly. Are you worse off for ignoring
them? Then take the appropriate action and work towards a better life. You
have all the resources you need before you. You know what to do. So just do
it.</p>

<p>It is easier said than done to accomplish such a feat, but perhaps here is
also a good time to remind you of your priorities. You don’t have to do
everything everybody else thinks is good for you. You don’t have to become
vegetarian and do yoga and lift heavy weights and play basketball if you don’t
see those activites as priorities. You don’t have to do anything that isn’t a
priority? If you don’t know what your priorities are, I’d suggest you think
about whether you have an itch in your life. Do you have some desire, some
nagging ideas, some thing which can propel you towards greatness? PhD students
are likely all aware of this. It takes, for most people, a lot of
soul-searching and (years of) painful thinking before they finally find that
area of the world which absolutely holds their attention. One day they’re
thinking about how much they hate having committed to networking when they
realize they have a brilliant idea for compiler optimization. If that itch
for compilers is real, the more they scratch it the more it feeds them. The
less they scratch it, the more it eats away at them. The scratch becomes the
<a href="https://xrdt.github.io/xrdt.github.io/2018/09/13/defining-your-life.html">central engine of their lives</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you have an itch or not, the priorities must be things
that increase your desire to be alive. Once you want to be alive, the rest
will follow. What makes you want to be alive? Your work and your interpersonal
relationships. So focus on cultivating good relationships and on finding
fulfilling work. Once you have found what you need, nurture and develop and
refine them further so you wake up every day more energized than the previous.
That is the way to live a good life.</p>
