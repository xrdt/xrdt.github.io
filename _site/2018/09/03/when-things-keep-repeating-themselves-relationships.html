  <h1>When Things Keep Repeating Themselves (Relationships)</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">September 3, 2018</h3>

  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />

<p>A friend and I recently agreed to take a break from our relationship. Some
trust issues had emerged and we no longer enjoyed each other’s company. Any
attempts we made at mending the relationship strained it more, so we decided
it was best to wait things out and see if time could heal this wound.</p>

<p>Just before we initiated the break, I noticed that my friend had been
repeating himself a lot to me. Nearly every time we met or spoke over video
call, he would reiterate his values, his motivations, and his goals for
the relationship. I would nod and acknowledge receipt of his message, but
somehow he would keep trying to relay the same information to me. Each time,
I would receive the information as though I was receiving it for the first
time. There were days when I preferred to not hear him talk about his goals
for the relationship, because I didn’t share those goals, but I never
interrupted with: “I get it. You’ve said this a million times before.”</p>

<p>That realization, that he had been repeating himself a million times to me
and that we had been stuck in this loop for several months drove my to finally
call for a break. There was a communication gap between us that probably
would never be resolved.</p>

<p>Looking further back on our relationship, I’m not sure I was ever truly
honest with myself about whether I enjoyed the friendship. He was a nice
friend, someone I could rely on as a weekend outing companion or as a
conversation partner, but I’m not sure he was ever the kind of person I wanted
to commit to beyond that.</p>

<p>I’m glad we ended so amicably, but I wish I was more rational and honest in
assessing the status of our relationship. The repetition was a big giveaway
that there were serious cracks in our relationship, but it was so late by the
time I noticed it.</p>

<p>My goal for my other relationships is to be honest with myself about whether
they are worth my investment and to invest deeply in them if they are. People
are all too willing to let you fade into the background under the premise of
“they’re busy building their career” or the related “they’re busy with sets
and academic pursuits”. By the time you have some free time, your
relationships with the people you care about will have become so thin that it
will seem pointless to try being with them again. Our relationships with
others fuel our happiness. Let us remind ourselves daily of their importance
and allocate our resources correspondingly.</p>
