  <h1>Hot and Cool</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 21, 2018</h3>

<p>I was thinking to myself a couple of weeks ago: “Isn’t it funny how ‘hot’ and
‘cool’ can mean the opposite thing in some circumstances and mean similar
things in other circumstances?”</p>

<p>If the meanings aren’t clear, I’ll spell them out now:<br />
<strong>Opposite Meaning</strong><br />
hot – having a high degree of heat or a high temperature<br />
cool – of or at a low temperature</p>

<p><strong>Similar Meaning</strong><br />
hot – currently popular, fashionable, or in demand<br />
cool – fashionably attractive or impressive</p>

<p>I later realized a more subtle distinction between the similar meanings.
Hot is used to describe fashionableness that everybody else sees. Cool is
used to describe a personal evaluation of attractiveness or impressiveness.
If I say, “Python is a hot programming language”, I’m distancing myself from
the evaluation of its hotness. Everybody else seems to think Python is hot
stuff, based on the latest StackOverflow surveys and on some other industry
surveys, but I don’t really have a view on how awesome Python is. To contrast,
consider if I said: “Python is a cool programming language”. In this case,
I’m imparting a personal view of how great Python is.</p>

<p>If this subtlety is correct, then the <em>similar</em> meanings of hot and cool are
just an exterior vs interior evaluation of the popularity of a thing.</p>
