  <h1>If You Find Yourself Browsing, Consider Diving Deep</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 30, 2018</h3>

  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />

<p>I find that when I am bored and have access to my computer or
phone, I tend to desperately and stupidly browse. For example, I’ll idly
switch between books I have loaded in my iBooks library (I removed iBooks
from my phone a couple days ago, so this is no longer valid). Or I’ll
Google some question on Reddit like “best places to eat in X” and then
follow more and more of the “Related/Relevant/Interesting/i.e. Suck
All Your Time Away Until it’s 2am and You’re Wondering Why You Stayed Up So
Late Wasting Time on the Internet When You Have 8am Class” links that are on
some of the major threads. Regardless of what the “I’m bored, let’s browse”
activity is, it ends up being a complete waste of time and complete brain
killer. I have no more energy or motivation to get anything actually
worthwhile done after the “browse until I’m bored of browsing” period than I
did before.</p>

<p>I think the solution to this problem is to take a break (from digital media,
especially) and then dive deep into something. This works because boredom is a
sign that my brain is exhausted or that it’s confused. The break is a time
to hit refresh and reset my mental energies. Dale Chihuly once said something
along the lines of: “It’s not the physical exhaustion that tires you out, it’s
mental exhaustion.” I agree with that statement, but also want to note that
physical needs can create the illusion of mental exhaustion. For example,
people on low-carb diets often feel low-energy and sleepy because they’re not
eating enough. Their body responds not with hunger but with signals to rest
and conserve energy.</p>

<p>Once my mental energies are in order, it’s time to resolve my confusion.
The only way to become unconfused is to go deep into the topic of confusion
so you can understand where you got confused, why you got confused, and how
to move forward. Going deep can mean more Google research, reading
Wikipedia, asking a friend, or just moving on. Sometimes you won’t understand
something until you’ve experienced more. Sometimes you have you trust that
your hand will understand before your head. If you go through the motions
enough times, things will eventually become clear.</p>

<p>Browsing is a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/automatic-you/201208/infinite-scroll-the-webs-slot-machine">dangerous habit</a>.
It’s a drain on your mental energy and a waste of time. If you want to live a
fulfilling life, you should focus on what makes you truly happy. I don’t
think browsing will ever be an activity that makes you truly happy.</p>
