  <h1>The Ideal Asking Price</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 30, 2018</h3>

<p>I believe the ideal way to get paid as a consultant or product seller or
service seller is to set a minimum acceptable price and then ask your client
or customer to pay you what they think your work is worth. The minimum
acceptable price is there is make sure you still make a reasonable living off
your work. What is beautiful about this setup is the level of confidence it
implies the producer has in his work. This setup also forces the payer to
think a little harder about the purchase they’re making and to appreciate (or
not) the craft they’re purchasing <a href="#1d">[1]</a><a name="1u"></a>.</p>

<p>The only place I’ve seen this pay system applied is with <a href="https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways">Captain Games</a>.
Most of their games are “name your own price”, and the most recent three are
“name your own price above x”. I haven’t bought any of their games, but I have
a lot of respect for the developers for being so confident in their work that
they can run this way.</p>

<p><a href="#1u">[1]</a><a name="1d"></a>
Every activity, when pursued to some kind of (Platonic, maybe) ideal, becomes
a craft. Engineers and scientists and artists all talk about their work as a
craft. They’re immersed in the beauty of what they’re creating and the
principles underlying the creation.</p>
