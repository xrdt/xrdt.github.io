  <h1>Living a Good Life</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 11, 2018</h3>

<p>The fundamental criterion for having a good life is to want to be alive.</p>

<p>Thus, if you want to live a good life, you must find those things which make
you want to be alive.</p>

<p>Every action is accompanied by a motivation. Your life also needs a
motivation. The journey to find that motivation will likely be miserable, but
a life without that motivation will be even more unfortunate. It is better
to earnestly try and never succeed than to declare defeat before trying.</p>

<p>The human mind thrives when it is being challenged. Try to find something
which you can dedicate yourself to. You need to find a whetstone against
which you can slowly but surely train yourself (磨練）. Don’t worry about
feeling like a failure or actually failing. These obstacles are necessary
teachers in your journey to awakening and a purposeful life.</p>
