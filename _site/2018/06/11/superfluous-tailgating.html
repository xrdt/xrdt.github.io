  <h1>Traffic Laws</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">June 11, 2018</h3>

<p><strong>__Traffic Laws__</strong>:
I got tailgated yesterday while driving the speed limit. I wish people would
understand that the speed limits are not suggestions. They are designed to
reduce accidents and should be followed, under all circumstances. Realize that
the efficiency of your car significantly drops if you go above 55 - 60mph.
I don’t think the risk you take with your life that you incur by going 80, 90,
100mph on the highway is worth it.</p>

<p>Stop signs are not suggestions. Please, please, please, come to a full
stop and look both sides before you proceed. One of my friends nearly died
when a negligent driver cruised through a stop sign after only looking one way
and crashed into the side of her car.</p>

<p>Turn signals are not a “do it when I feel like it” convention. Remind yourself
that you are not the only person on the road. The other drives haven’t the
slightest idea what you’re thinking. Could you please demonstrate the
slightest courtesy to all the other drivers by giving them an indication of
where you plan on going? Could you also take the extra second to look at your
side mirror and at your blind spot before you initiate a lane change? Looking
in your side mirror is not a convenience. Your blind spot is <strong>blind</strong>
spot for a reason! Please watch for your safety and the safety of others. Every
corner you cut off the traffic laws while on the road increases the
likelihood of accidents and so many other complications on the roads we
all share. Please get it straight in your head to be <em>courteous</em> and <em>decent</em>
towards everybody else.</p>

<p>If you are making a right turn, please move into the bike lane. Also, please
look in your side mirror to make sure there are no bikers coming up alongside
you when you move over. If you are stopping on the right-most lane at a
stop sign or light, please move to the left so people can make right turns.</p>

<p>You are <em>not</em> obligated by law to make a right on red.</p>

<p>You <em>should</em> stop before the crosswalk before moving into the crosswalk for
right turns. This is so you can check for pedestrians. Pedestrians have the
right of way.</p>

<p>You can make left turns on red from one-way streets onto one-way streets,
assuming the directions line up.</p>

<p>Please stop shaming people for doing well on their written drivers tests.
When did not caring about knowing the rules of a dangerous activity become
the cool thing to do?</p>

<p>Please stop trying to seek the easy way out on your drivers’ test by going to
“easy” counties. Driving test requirements are already very low. Please
realize how salient and painful the consequences of bad driving are and help
to establish a precedent of keeping our roads safe.</p>

<p>Do <strong>not ever</strong> trust your car to Autopilot or some similar automatic driving
system. Driving is a dangerous activity, regardless of who is behind the
wheel. There is not enough evidence that computers are actually better at
driving than us. Please pay attention, for the sake of your life and for the
sake of everybody’s else’s safety.</p>

<p>Turn on your lights when dusk hits, when it is foggy outside, when it is
raining, when it is snowing, on windy roads, and before sunrise. Even if you
can’t see better, everybody else who is around you will be able to see you
better. I don’t know about you, but I think helping everybody else see you
is a great way to prevent them from crasing into you.</p>

<p>Take care of your car. Your car is a machine that needs regular maintenance.
Check your lights, your oil, your tires, your battery, etc. Also know how
to deal with emergencies like flat tires. These things are simple and many
situations can be dealt with just by paying attention to the signs and
taking care of things when they first appear.</p>

<p>Develop spatial and performance awareness of your car.
Learn how to park and get out of parking spots properly. Parking lots are a
prime place for accidents because there are a lot of people and cars moving
around in tight spaces and because most people park with the front of the car
into the spot. Learning to reverse park can certainly help reduce the number
of accidents because it’s easier to back into a space between stationary
objects than it is to back into a space with moving objects. Develop a sense
of the handling and acceleration of your car so you know how to handle tough
road situations.</p>

<p>Build good habits! This is the most important. Write down a list of things you
should do when driving and follow that routine. Check your seat, mirrors,
your headlights, the AC, the music, etc. when you first get in the car. Try
to reduce the number of minor things you need to deal with when on the road.
When on the road, make sure to pay attention to the right things. Look out
your mirrors every so often to check for people around you. Look out your side
mirror and blind spot for people next to you or just behind you. Look
out the back of your car when you back up so you can <em>see</em> what’s going on
outside your car.</p>

<p>I don’t know when being safe became the lame thing to do, but driving is
absolutely a playing where safety is of paramount importance. A lot of
accidents can be prevented just by developing the right habits.</p>
