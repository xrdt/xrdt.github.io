  <h1>Testing 1 2 3</h1>

<p>Just an exercise in rhyming today. The path the lyrics traces out is not
consistent, so don’t read too much into the “hidden, subliminal messages”.</p>

<p>Happy first post of October.</p>

<p><strong>Start:</strong>
What I’m trying to do is to up my skills so I can get to live like
royalty<br />
Don’t tell me you’re adding value to society<br />
I can see from the car you drive you ain’t worth more than poverty<br />
So don’t go walking around like you high on some fumes<br />
We all know that stuff bad for you because it just subsumes<br />
Your brain and then your mind starts going down the drain<br />
Until there’s nothing left at the end of this refrain<br /></p>

<p>We all trying to find meaning in life<br />
For some of us, that means taking a wife<br />
Yoking yourself to each other, thinking that will end your strife<br />
Y’all saying you hate working the 8 to 5 grind<br />
You would rather sit around thinking you’re one of a kind<br />
Hoping one day to find<br />
The golden ticket that will get you out of this bind<br /></p>

<p>Let me tell you your thinking’s gone off the tracks<br />
That’s right I’m calling you a bunch of whacks<br />
Y’all sitting there with bottles of Jack<br />
Pretending you in the corner office, hang your jacket up on the rack<br />
When will you wake up and realize that you’re wasting your life<br />
Stop spending 10 hours on work a day it’s pumped you full of spite<br />
You’re angry and you hate it but you do it for the pay<br />
Is the pay gonna save your soul when you’re 80 and grey?<br />
Will it make your grandkids proud or will they say “go away”<br />
And will you see in their eyes that glimmer of yesterday<br />
When you were still full of hope and chasin’ after destiny
(pronounce more destin-ay for rhyme)<br /></p>

<p>When did you forget that essential formula for meaning in life<br />
It tells us that work and relationships are our bedrock<br />
Everything else just distracts from what’s right<br />
Don’t think you can get away with delayed gratification<br />
Your brain needs constant reaffirmation<br />
What I mean is you gotta put in the hours every day, prove that you got
some dedication<br />
To your intentions<br />
You can call it your purpose in life but if you’re a kid you probably see it
as doing what you like<br />
That’s right, follow your dreams, and hope that one day you will be given the
means to lead a team that will tear apart the seams of this regime and set us
free to be happy, fulfilled, and utterly esteemed<br />
For work was given to us to be good for body and soul<br />
Let us find pleasure in applying our skills<br />
It will fill a spiritual hole<br />
But let’s not neglect the other part of the formula, we need to pay our
relationship bills<br /></p>

<p>Your work is your engine<br />
Your relationships are your fuel<br />
So don’t play the fool, garbage in garbage out<br />
If someone isn’t making you happy, don’t be sorry, just acknowledge you
struck out<br />
Move on, seek closure, the world’s so big you’re bound to find someone who
will hear you out<br />
But remember to close your mouth<br />
Every once in a while because communication’s on a single lane road<br />
There ain’t no passing, no cutting off, only head-on collision<br />
But if that’s what you want I’d suggest you check your vision<br />
So you can see the person before your eyes, and realize<br />
Just how important you could be to each other’s lives<br />
Once you find the right people you’ll be well on the track towards becoming
healthy, wealthy, and wise<br />
And remember to treat others right, too, because they playing this same game
on the flip-side of you<br />
So be patient, be loving, be gracious and be grateful for your crew<br /></p>

<p>I hope this little jingle was useful to you<br />
Take a deep breath, clean out your mind with a mental Achoo!<br />
You can go back and review but for now just relax and think it through<br />
Two simple pieces, work and relationships<br />
Just like Reese’s, delicious together, unsinkable ship<br />
Once you get going at a clip you’ll feel really hip<br />
That’s all I got to say tonight, have a nice trip<br /></p>
