  <h1>Exponential Growth</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">November 17, 2018</h3>
  <p><em>Author: Bianca Yang</em><br />
<em>Email: <a href="mailto:ipacifics@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the XDRT Blog">ipacifics@gmail.com</a></em><br /></p>

<p>Economics, I’m telling you, all they talk about is rationality<br />
Having multiple optionality isn’t computational insanity<br />
Because we all living in hyper-reality<br />
Our brains as good as cyborgs, this is the new age of humanity<br /></p>

<p>Gotta think in terms of opportunity cost, margins, incentive theory<br />
Markets are the best way to maximize our collective productivity<br /> Productivity optimization is our calling, let’s not get confused, homie<br />
The government wants to maximize GDP, get us all to take responsibility<br />
Incentivize us with low interest, tax breaks, this is the land of opportunity<br /></p>

<p>Don’t you see it, sometimes we follow Friedman, sometimes follow Keynes<br />
Every regime is different, but the long-run behavior is the same<br />
We all looking for exponential growth, hockey stick, it goes by different names<br />
Unsustainable you say, that’s the name of the game<br />
We fighting a losing battle against entropy, can’t give up, that’s lame<br />
Every so often we have a revolution, spark non-linearity, don’t disdain<br />
The power of the human mind, we on a roll, follow the gain<br /></p>

<p>We limited by our capital so we invented debt<br />
Let you use more than you own isn’t that a risky bet<br />
So the debt owners they charge usury some high numbers they like to set<br />
But don’t worry I’m responsible ain’t no credit card regret<br />
Take a look at 2008, people losing homes moving to Tibet<br />
Just a phenomenon of the credit cycle is what they want you to think is correct<br />
Cycles are inevitable, we humans aren’t stable like computer chipsets<br />
But what if we didn’t use money move beyond give and get<br /></p>

<p>We now limited by our attention, by our time<br />
No longer have to work with nature, get covered in grime<br />
We pretend we getting closer with everybody when we’re online<br />
But all we really doing is turning our brains into slime<br />
They say the world’s at our fingertips<br />
Just ask Google and you will receive a box of top hits<br />
But don’t you know searching can’t replace understanding<br />
The human mind needs deep stimulation before it’s thriving<br />
That’s why we value creativity and imagination<br />
Reveal our ingenuity make things better for the next generation<br /></p>

<p>That’s where the real exponential growth lies<br />
Help us transcend the present move up into the skies<br />
Life is too short to waste open your eyes<br />
Take control of your mind and body don’t you realize<br />
No limits to your potential stop eating fries<br />
Your objective is to build upon previous generations it all jives<br />
With Newton standing on the shoulders of giants say your goodbyes<br />
To disease to suffering to inequality to depravity to cries<br />
For help<br />
Not Yelp<br />
But kelp<br /></p>

<p>Think about how you want to spend the rest of your life<br />
Pursue exponential growth for growth’s sake it’s a line of strife<br />
Gotta be sharp as a surgeon be quick with the knife<br />
Ain’t nobody blowing horns we all just playing the fife<br /></p>

<p>But remember what’s real in the world, what makes you happy<br />
Think about humanity, your humanness, this ain’t sappy<br />
Emotions are good caring is good compassion is good say hi to your pappy<br />
Get out there, see the world, create value for society<br />
Real value you can see, touch people, that’s reality<br />
This is the real exponential growth, growth of humanity<br /></p>
