  <h1>Why Didn't You Tell Me Earlier?</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">November 12, 2018</h3>

<p>Why didn’t you tell me earlier?<br />
Your sister tried but you kept saying you didn’t hear her<br />
So now you crying bloody murder<br />
because you didn’t get the job you’d work for<br /></p>

<p>That’s why I keep saying you gotta use that brain of yours<br />
Opportunities don’t just wash up on the shores<br />
They ain’t as easy to pick up as whores<br />
How’d you end up cleaning your pores?<br /></p>

<p>I hope you learned from this incident<br />
Not to sit back and be so complacent<br />
You gotta prepare, show up, deliver, like your brother Trent<br />
You could learn a lot from him, we all rooting for your improvement<br /></p>

<p>What’s that? You going on again, didn’t tell me earlier?<br />
Speak louder, I can’t hear when you murmur<br />
I don’t have time for this, I’m going to eat a burger<br /></p>

<p>Quit following me around<br />
You like a sick puppy dog, desperate for love but belonging to the pound<br />
Get back to work, figure out how you’re going to make your life sound<br />
Don’t be whining, I’m paying for you to turn your life around<br /></p>

<p>I didn’t tell you earlier? Please<br />
Have you ever thought that your brain used to be made of peas?<br />
That you used to say the world is flat, the flu is a flea’s disease?<br />
You’ve come a long way, but don’t stop. One day you’ll be as rich as Jay Z<br /></p>

<p>The phone is ringing, go pick it up<br />
What? Aunt Marge’s reading tea leaves in her cup?<br />
Cousin Bobby’s outside trying to do a pull up?<br />
You don’t look to well, are you going to throw up?<br /></p>

<p>What’s gotten into you, you’re acting like a nervous wreck<br />
Didn’t you tell me you took care of that bounced check?<br />
Now you saying debt collectors after you what the heck?<br />
Why didn’t you tell me earlier, now the yoke’s on my neck<br /></p>
