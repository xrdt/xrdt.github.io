  <h1>“Money is a Distraction“</h1>

<p>Money is a means to an end. It is an external measure of success. But the measure that matters, if you want to <em>do things that matter</em>, is your <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/2017/12/warren-buffett-score-counts-investing-internal-scorecard/">inner scorecard</a>.</p>

<p>Your inner scorecard is your measure for truth in the world. It stores your values, your beliefs, and your priorities, all the things that truly define how you perceive and proceed through the world. If you abandon your inner scorecard for distractions like money, prestige, or power, you will never achieve what you truly want to enable in this world.</p>

<p>Let’s think about ways in which money has distracted us. Resources like oil and gas are priceless because they are nonrenewable, yet we have managed to place a price on them. This price and its undulations have fooled us into mismanaging these resources and damaging the environment. Human connection is priceless, yet Facebook will happily let the highest bidding advertisers take advantage of your relationships to make themselves more money. Time is priceless, yet we can place a price on our money by selling ourselves as consultants. Purpose is priceless, yet we’re willing to accept direction from a company in return for a stable salary and benefits. Our humanness is priceless, yet we’re willing to give all that away for professional prestige and accomplishments. We all want money, because everybody’s gotta make a living.</p>

<p>But what is truly fulfilling to you? Is it helping people be one with nature? Is it teaching the next generation? Is it bringing healthcare to those who don’t have it? Is it spending time with your friends? Think about what kind of life you want to be able to share to your grandchildren when you’re 80 years old. Think about the kind of world you want to live in when you’re 80 years old. Think about the kind of life you would be proud to live each day. Uncover those truths and pursue them passionately. I’ll bet you what you’d truly be proud to pursue isn’t money.</p>
