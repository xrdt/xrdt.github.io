  <h1>New Work Schedule</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 1, 2018</h3>

<p>The current work schedule expects humans to work consistently for too long.
It is nearly impossible to sustain eight hours of work without becoming
exhausted by the end of the day. This work schedule also clashes with
childrens’ school schedules. Because everyone works for nearly the same hours
every day, working people have much more difficulty in scheduling visits to
places like the bank, the doctor’s office, the dentist’s office.</p>

<p>One way to resolve these time conflicts is to regulate when certain types of
businesses are allowed to be open. This sounds ridiculous since people have
already baked into their heads this idea of “working hours” and because people
don’t want to be told what to do by the government. I intuitively want to say
it’s a bad idea, but I’m a bit brain-blocked as to why.</p>

<p>Another way to resolve this conflict is to put everyone on flex hours. Every
business is technically open 24/7. If you want to stop by, you can ping the
owner or operator when you get there. This sounds attractive from a selfish
consumer’s view, but this model disrupts working flow. This model will also
end up placing too many demands on people’s time. For operations that require
coordinated effort, people will still set shifts so life balance is maintained.</p>

<p>I am going to propose a less ridiculous working schedule that should prevent
end of workday fatigue.</p>

<p>Shift 1: 9am - 12:30pm<br />
Break: 12:30pm - 3pm<br />
Shift 2: 3pm - 6:30pm<br />
<em>Total Working Hours</em>: 7</p>

<p>Compare this with the current working schedule:
Shift 1: 9am - 12pm<br />
Break: 12pm - 1pm<br />
Shift 2: 1pm - 5pm<br />
<em>Total Working Hours</em>: 7</p>

<p>My schedule is more convenient for parents who need to pick up and drop off
their kids at school. It also gives a nice, long break at midday for lunch or
a nap or running errands. For those who would complain that I’m eating too
far into the evening, I’d say that you could restructure your life. Most
people eat and relax or work more in the evening. I never really enjoy
eating dinner, so I would just not eat that meal. Rather, I’d eat a larger
lunch and achieve the same daily caloric effect. There is evidence to
suggest that eating fewer meals is better for you because fasting promotes
some kind of beneficial chemical processes. The evening is a time to relax
and unwind. Don’t try to cram too many things into a space where your body
wants to loosen and let go. If you find yourself running out of time to
accomplish your goals, either review and cull your list of things to
accomplish or become more productive during the day time.</p>

<p>What do you think? I have a schedule like this on Tuesday and Thursdays this
term. The long lunch period is <em>extremely</em> relaxing. In fact, today, I took
some of the time to lay on some grass and watch the clouds.</p>

<p>I don’t like reading email, but you can email me if you want to chat about
this.</p>

<p>今天的作品是一種詩。我失去了寫歌的興趣。反正我還沒發覺寫歌的訣竅，暫時集註著寫
散文好了。</p>

<p>我曾經覺得自己寫文章的風格太死板，好像我從開始這個部落格到現在沒有進步。
但這樣的想法應該不對。我認為寫字只是整理腦子裡的思想的方式。你如果想得通，
你應該也能寫得通。所以我的問題在於我的國語技術還不夠流利。但我不會放棄，因為
我知道我只要每天專心的練習就會達到我渴望的境界。</p>

<p><em>回家</em></p>

<p>回到老家探親卻更想逛小時候最愛的老店<br />
老闆早已退休關店但那店還站著，像回憶裡的里程碑<br />
我還記得我第一次來到這家店，我那天好像跟媽媽去逛街然後走丟了<br />
身邊的人都很陌生，我只想剁起來，等著媽媽用她那雙溫柔的手臂擁抱著我<br />
我那時還矮，所以只好匆忙的竄過各式各樣的腳腿去找容身之處。<br />
幸虧那天沒被人踢到。我走了好久才發現一個看氣來比較平易近人的門框<br />
我立即的躲進那個洞。外面的人好像都沒發覺到我這個小鬼<br />
我只好坐著，頭背靠著牆，等著天使來救我。<br />
沒多久我就聽到了一個人的聲音。那叔叔的聲音非常低、又非常溫和<br />
我那時想了，如果我終生留在這裡，聽著那叔叔說話，我會多高興。<br />
但那夢想不會在這一生實現，因為那位叔叔是這家店的老闆。老闆不許客人隨便躲在店
的角落裡<br />
我突然被叔叔抱起，然後被放在玻璃櫃檯上。櫃檯裡放著一大堆莫名其妙的雜貨，
我完全認不出來<br />
