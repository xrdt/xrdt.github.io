  <h1>New Work Schedule</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">March 1, 2018</h3>

<p>The current work schedule expects humans to work consistently for too long.
It is nearly impossible to sustain eight hours of work without becoming
exhausted by the end of the day. This work schedule also clashes with
childrens’ school schedules. Because everyone works for nearly the same hours
every day, working people have much more difficulty in scheduling visits to
places like the bank, the doctor’s office, the dentist’s office.</p>

<p>One way to resolve these time conflicts is to regulate when certain types of
businesses are allowed to be open. This sounds ridiculous since people have
already baked into their heads this idea of “working hours” and because people
don’t want to be told what to do by the government. I intuitively want to say
it’s a bad idea, but I’m a bit brain-blocked as to why.</p>

<p>Another way to resolve this conflict is to put everyone on flex hours. Every
business is technically open 24/7. If you want to stop by, you can ping the
owner or operator when you get there. This sounds attractive from a selfish
consumer’s view, but this model disrupts working flow. This model will also
end up placing too many demands on people’s time. For operations that require
coordinated effort, people will still set shifts so life balance is maintained.</p>

<p>I am going to propose a less ridiculous working schedule that should prevent
end of workday fatigue.</p>

<p>Shift 1: 9am - 12:30pm<br />
Break: 12:30pm - 3pm<br />
Shift 2: 3pm - 6:30pm<br />
<em>Total Working Hours</em>: 7</p>

<p>Compare this with the current working schedule:
Shift 1: 9am - 12pm<br />
Break: 12pm - 1pm<br />
Shift 2: 1pm - 5pm<br />
<em>Total Working Hours</em>: 7</p>

<p>My schedule is more convenient for parents who need to pick up and drop off
their kids at school. It also gives a nice, long break at midday for lunch or
a nap or running errands. For those who would complain that I’m eating too
far into the evening, I’d say that you could restructure your life. Most
people eat and relax or work more in the evening. I never really enjoy
eating dinner, so I would just not eat that meal. Rather, I’d eat a larger
lunch and achieve the same daily caloric effect. There is evidence to
suggest that eating fewer meals is better for you because fasting promotes
some kind of beneficial chemical processes. The evening is a time to relax
and unwind. Don’t try to cram too many things into a space where your body
wants to loosen and let go. If you find yourself running out of time to
accomplish your goals, either review and cull your list of things to
accomplish or become more productive during the day time.</p>

<p>What do you think? I have a schedule like this on Tuesday and Thursdays this
term. The long lunch period is <em>extremely</em> relaxing. In fact, today, I took
some of the time to lay on some grass and watch the clouds.</p>

<p>I don’t like reading email, but you can email me if you want to chat about
this.</p>
