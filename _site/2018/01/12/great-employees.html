  <h1>Great Employees</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">January 12, 2018</h3>

<p>There’s a guy at work who recently helped me think through the design of a web application. I have little experience with the broad field of software engineering, and know hardly anything about the web beyond the fact that I use too much of it every day, so his help was much appreciated. There’s two parts to my appreciation. One is for his being willing to help. Most people aren’t good enough to bother. They’re just too selfish or too afraid to step up and better their fellow man. The second part is for the effectiveness of his teaching. This coworker really knows what he’s talking about and knows how to teach. He introduces concepts in a way that makes sense, he checks for understanding, and he’s happy to answer questions. I had my doubts about him when I first met him, because he didn’t seem to have much to work to do. But he’s now proven himself as a worthy addition to the team, especially to the interns whom he’s helped.</p>

<p>The best snowboard instructor I’ve had so far confided in me that he felt the ski school he was working at should focus on hiring good people. The snowboarding and skiing can be taught, but bad people skills are hard to correct in adults. Teachers need to be confident and firm. I see too many teachers on the slopes who are shy about correcting their students or leading them through “silly exercises”. I also see too many teachers on the slopes who take a cavalier attitude towards teaching and either leave their students to fend for themselves or ignore their concerns. I have a sense that teachers who are assigned to larger groups tend to shirk their responsibilities more than teachers with small groups because they think it’s too hard to keep track of a larger number of people. Those teachers basically just herd their students from point a to point b, without even a modicum of coaching or a sincere good job. The best teachers recognize their students’ limits, psychological and physical, and know when to press harder and when to let back. Teachers are major role models in our world, and it’s a shame when people take the job for the money and refuse to live up to their responsibilities. It’s also a shame that people don’t give feedback where feedback is deserved. Great work deserves more than a tip. It deserves to be shared with the company so that person can be recognized and promoted. Bad work deserves more than hushed complaints once you’re at home. It also deserves to be recognized so that person can undergo training or be fired. Companies have political roadblocks which may prevent them from recognizing good and bad. You can help by submitting your thoughts and by speaking up when the time is right.</p>

<p>殺人遊戲</p>

<p>我上次跟一些朋友去吃飯時，有一位突然提出 殺人遊戲 這四個字。我從沒聽過這種遊戲所以我笨拙地問各位這到底是什麼玩意。我還以為是大陸編出來的心活動，怪我落伍就好了。沒人想解釋，所以我最親密的朋友低聲地跟我說這遊戲在英文叫 ＭＡＦＩＡ。喔。原來如此。我又露出我中文程度有多弱。但這沒關係，我最近每天都在練習我的聽說讀寫，一定不能再讓人家看不起我的中文！</p>

<p>我因為最近又想起這個遊戲所以想跟大家分享一個即興想起的殺人遊戲例子:</p>

<p><u>口白（主持人）</u>：大家請坐下，我們要先分配角色。請把眼睛關上，我會在我們做的圈外繞一次。我如果在你肩上敲一次，你就是殺手，我如果在你肩上敲兩次，你就是警察，我如果在你肩上敲三次，你就是天使。我如果沒碰你的肩膀，你就是平民。大家白了嗎？好，那我開始了，請把眼睛閉上。</p>

<p><u>口白</u>：好，大家可以張開眼睛。個人的身份都明白嗎？個人的責任都明白嗎？<br />
參加者ㄧ：啊，不好意思，可以給我解釋一下每個角色的責任嗎？<br />
<u>口白</u>：好的，沒問題。我們今天有兩位殺手，他們的目標是把其他參加者全給殺掉，只有他們生存。我們也有兩位警察，他們在夜裡可以查出一個人的真正身份。我們還有一位天使，她每一回能拯救一個人。餘剩的人都是平民。平民的責任是把殺手全給殺掉，這樣對你們無辜人的生命再也沒有危險了。如果兩位殺手在其他角色死以前被發現，遊戲就結束。如果殺手把其他角色先殺掉，那遊戲就是殺手贏的。懂了嗎？好，那我們開始吧！大家閉上眼睛！</p>

<p>殺手請醒！你們今天的目標是誰？好，謝謝，請回去睡覺。
警察請醒！你今天想查問誰的身份？好，謝謝，請回去睡覺。
天使請醒！你今天要救誰？好，謝謝，請回去睡覺。</p>

<p>大家起來！昨晚，參加者三因失眠而睡不著，他想出去在家旁的公園裡散散步再回來能幫他入睡。所以他穿好衣服，穿好鞋就出門了。但今天是一個很不吉的天。參加者三一到公園就被一位躲在樹後面的殺手刺殺。他的屍體今天早上才被一位運動員發現。請大家討論今天要把哪一位送上死刑。</p>

<p>。。。</p>

<p>故事你應該可自己繼續，我只想跟大家分享我對這遊戲的經歷。</p>
