  <h1>Some Thoughts from Yesterday & Today</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">January 19, 2018</h3>

<p>Here’s some thoughts I’ve had over the past two days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t bother coming if you’re not going to pay attention.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This came up during my game theory class yesterday afternoon. One of my classmates was sitting in the same row as me, a few seats to my left. She wasn’t paying the slightest attention to the class. Rather, she was busy typing an essay of an email to some professor. I think she only came to class because she needed to turn in her homework. But why did she stay when she knew she was going to waste the class time?</li>
      <li>I now avoid using my phone during class time. If I’m very tired, I may slip up and check my phone as a way to stay awake. But otherwise, I focus as much of my attention as possible on the lecture and taking notes. This has tremendously helped my retention of the material and has made completing problem sets much easier.</li>
      <li>I only take notes on paper. Taking note electronically is harder, especially when the professor uses formulas and diagrams, and it’s more a transcription of lecture than my digested version of the content.</li>
      <li>My motivation to pay attention in class has nothing to do with the money. It’s all about my interest in building my attention span and my interest in learning the material. Reading manga in class, texting on Messenger, doing other sets, writing emails; all of these activities are either not important or a sign of bad time management. You know exactly what you need to get done within a week and you should be more than capable of planning out your time to complete those tasks.</li>
      <li>So, don’t bother coming if you’re not going to pay attention. If you’re bored, either leave or entertain yourself with something other than your phone or computer. I’d rather have you daydreaming or doodling than scrolling Facebook for 1000th time, looking for a funny video a friend got tagged in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>My handwriting is inconsistent and should be cursive instead of print.
    <ul>
      <li>Argue what you want about the virtues of the digital age and the obsolescence of handwriting. I believe handwriting is a better linkage from input to memory and will continue to improve mine until it is completely legible, consistent, and beautiful to look at.</li>
      <li>I’ve started using cursive to take notes in my classes. By the end of term, my handwriting should be much closer to something I can be proud of.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I want an aromatherapy set.
    <ul>
      <li>This thought occurred to me today when I returned to my room from the bathroom. My yoga mat was half-folded in the middle of the room and my humidifier was comfortably sitting on my chest of drawers. My mind suddenly jumped to images of wood-paneled, wood-floored yoga rooms with warm, dim lighting and aromatic steam. I wanted to be transported away from my current situation into that beautiful, relaxing world. And now I want an aromatherapy set and a diffuser. My current humidifier doesn’t support oil diffusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I used to hate commenting code but now it’s like an addiction.
    <ul>
      <li>I used to hate writing code because I had never written anything substantial, I was a selfish jerkface, and I didn’t do it while writing the code.</li>
      <li>Now, I comment everything. I love having comments because vim colors them pretty, breaking up the actual code, and because it saves me a modicum of mental effort in having to decipher my code on a reread.</li>
      <li>Comment your code because it makes everybody’s life easier!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>我最近一直覺得我的中文程度在退步。尤其在說的方面，我現在經常會發出錯的發音，看起來真的像外國人。所以我今天開始修練，讀了一篇短的演講。我本來想找一些比較著名的中文演講來念，但我最終只找到一大堆被翻成中文的英文演講。大部分是美國總統的發言。我還是著找毛澤東等類似人的演講但只找到人家述說他的一次演講的文章。難道中國歷史這麼長、國力這麼大的國家沒有創作值得稱為著名的演講？</p>

<p>我有可能在錯的地方找。但是我不相信我著麼名白的查詢會被 Google 看錯：「著名中國演講」。我最後找出了<a href="https://kknews.cc/zh-mo/history/26pbym9.html">這一個網站</a>，讀了第一篇文章。其他文章我明天再去練好了。</p>

<p>我不只是說力退步、寫字的方面也退了好幾步。現在因為習慣用電腦打字所以忘了怎麼寫很多基本的字。英文在這一方面比中文方便多了。英文字很容易就能照語音拼出來。但你如果不知道你要哪一個中文字，你很難隨便把他拼出來。有人認為中國孩子在制式考試表現得那麼優秀的一個因素是因為我們的語言比較注重熟記。但是我們並不能只像電腦一樣，鍛鍊記憶力。我們也要鍛鍊創意力，我們要去想未來、去創出新未來。現在，中國表現得很好，大陸的公司已經開疆很多新的做生意的方式，尤其在軟體方面。Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent 等公司都很創意，美國公司也在模仿他們的幾個 feature (不知這該怎麼用中文寫，有人能幫我改嗎？謝謝）。</p>

<p>我最近開始對煮飯跟焗烤更有興趣。我上個週末跟朋友試著做 brioche 跟 custard. Custard 的味道不錯，但麵包做得有點失望。我次日試了兩個不同的普通麵包食譜，也是失敗。但沒關係，我下次在試試看不同的作法，不同的材料，看我在哪裡做錯。</p>

<p>我明天要做日本式的<a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/korokke-croquette/">炸丸子</a>。如果好吃我在跟大家分享照片、訣竅。如果做的不好吃，我們假裝沒有發生這件事繼續過日子好了。</p>
