  <h1>The Joy of Life</h1>
  <h3 class="post--date">January 15, 2018</h3>

<p>I’ve been thinking about house designs again recently. I’m a big fan of comfortable houses. I want a place that feels nice to go home to and has lots of nooks and crannies I can safely nestle myself into. Warm lighting would be nice against wood floor of similar color. Carpet sounds nice, but wood floors with well-placed rugs can do the trick.</p>

<p>I want a well-lit workspace somewhere that’s a bit hidden from the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. The bedroom should be large enough for a bed up against a wall or corner and a futon. The bathroom should be spacious and well-heated. Bright lights in the bathroom would be nice. In fact, having a variety of lights I can toggle, from warm to bright, would be ideal. There should be a small shelf in the corner for towels and things.</p>

<p>The living room I’m not decided on. Most living rooms now have that standard setup which centers around a TV. I’m think I’d like to forgo the TV to focus more on the social interactions people will have when together in the living room. A patio would be nice, so I can sunbathe or just enjoy the outside world. An open kitchen is ok, but I want it mostly closed. The kitchen should be focused on food-making and cleanup, not a hang-out place. I would like to maintain a library. Perhaps I’ll have bookshelves embedded into the walls of my living room that are hidden with sliding panels. I don’t need a lot of space, but I do want enough so I can walk around when frustrated and entertain friends.</p>

<p>There is a certain beauty to life which I’m trying to appreciate more and more each day. I don’t know exactly what kind of life I want to live or where I will go forward from here, but I hope I’ll be proud of it. I’ve probably said this many, many times on this blog, but I’ll repeat it because I want to reassure myself of some deep insecurity. Maybe one day I’ll move out into the countryside and regain my composure. Relax into my memories and fade away.</p>
