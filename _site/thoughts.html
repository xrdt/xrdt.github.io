    "title": "Reflection: 3 Days in San Diego",
    "body": "2019/07/12 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com A couple of days before graduation (June 14, 2019), I took a trip with two Caltech friends down toSan Diego. We rented a car from Hertz for a few days (thank you AAA for waiving young driver fees!)and headed out at 9am from Caltech on Sunday. But apparently 9am was a really early departuretime…both my friends were asleep for pretty much the entire ride down. I took the 210 then the 5down until about Fashion Island. Once we got to that point, I took HWY 1 until I couldn’t, thengot back on the 5. Note: the nicest part of the 5 is the section from San Clemente to San Onofre. The road quality and views are the best along this strip. We hit a bit of traffic around Oceanside. I made the mistake of becoming upset at the traffic and taking surface streets to the next exit. Wegained zero time from my frustration. The total driving time was something like 3 hours. We ate lunch with my parents at the Argyle Steakhouse, abeautiful restaurant that’s next to the Aviara Golf Club andBatiquitos Lagoon. After lunch, we took a short walk alongthe Batiquitos Lagoon trail (too hot, forgot sunscreen), then headed to Encinitas for Handel’sIce Cream. My sister has been raving about Handels’ for forever,so now that I had the time and means to get to one, I was for sure going. I was no disappointed. Their ice cream is amazing. They have a huge board full of flavors, so you can go ham tryingeverything from Snappy Turtle to Graham Central Station (would recommend this flavor. It’s whatI got) to Buckeye. Don’t be fooled by the sizing, though. A “single” scoop is actually threemassive scoops. The cones are fresh, but the ice crea melts fast, so you’ll probably have a lessmessy time if you order a cup. After Handel’s, we walked on over to Moonlight Beach, where we enjoyed the sun, water, and windfor a couple hours. Moonlight Beach is a very lively beach. I would definitely recommend you checkit out if you end up with time on your hands in North County San Diego. A popular restaurant nearthe beach is Leucadia Pizzeria. They’ve got pretty solid pies andpastas. The whole of Encinitas downtown is pretty swell, too, so if you have time, definitely gocheck out the Self-Realization Fellowship andHansen’s (surf shop with ski / snowboard simulator in the back). After Moonlight, we headed home for a couple of hours of billiards and then dinner atTeri Cafe. Teri Cafe is a simply wonderful Japanese cafe out in Oceanside. They serve massive, delicious portions of teriyaki, ramen, sushi, etc at unbeatable prices. Definitely try them out if you are in the area. That evening, we bought tickets for the USS Midway and planned to meet up with some friends fromCaltech who were also planning to be at the ship the next morning. We planned to get up early inthe morning and arrive at the Midway by 10am, its opening time. That plan failed…partly becausepeople got up later than expected and partly because I had a last minute report to submit. . (you cansee the report here. Anyway, we ended up leaving past ten. Traffic was light, but we had a bit of issue finding parking near the Midway (I think I was justblind to the entrance to the Midway parking lot) so we looped to some other parking lot. Really,I think the pro strat on parking in downtown SD is to just use free parking from Balboa Parkand take a scooter or Uber to wherever you want to go. We found the other Caltech kids, who had been on the ship since 10am…(like responsible people,they hinted) and spent the next five or six hours on the ship. There is a ton to look at on thisship, especially if you care about aviation and boats and the navy and all that jazz. We didn’teven have time to look at the lower decks or listen to all the snippets about each of the aircraft. There are lots of volunteers on the ship, who will talk your ear off about the ship and their timein the military, so do take advantage of all that you can on this boat. There are also scheduledpresentations on things like the catapult system that you can pop a squat for (make sure to bringsun protection and food / water). By the time we did the island tour, though, we were all starving. One person threatened to collapse if we didn’t find food, like, now… We took a couple of Lyft scooters (best deal at $. 15/min) over toTacos El Cabron, a taco shop in the Gaslamp District. This taco shop was pretty expensive, probably over $4 per taco (small taco),but it did the trick. We zoomed back to our cars on scooters after the meal and then went overto Balboa Park. We walked from theOrgan Pavilion parking lot to thefountain outside the Fleet Science Centerthen did a loop around the Spanish Village Art Center before theother two Caltech kids headed off. They were just here for a day trip. We did a loop around thedesert garden (found a homeless guy setting up camp among he cacti), the rose garden, took a coupleof silly pictures in the Pepper Grove playground, and then headed off to Mission Bay for a loop anda half around Fiesta Island. I find it funny how I used to hate going to Balboa Park with my parents but now think Balboa Parkis such a gem and central attraction of the city. I suppose this is one of those pieces of“perspective” you pick up as you get older. Fiesta Island is not all that exciting of an island…but you can certainly find a good time onTecolote Shores orat SeaWorld! Towrap up the evening, we went to chow down some Torpastas. Torpastasare pasta sandwiches. I highly recommend the pesto sandwich~. That was it for day two. Day three, we got up nice and early for an 10am facial~. One of our group members was upset aboutthe idea of doing a facial so declined…(not surprising, honestly). After the facial, we rushedto my sister’s school for the post-graduation festivities. After that, we zoomed over toCarillo Ranch to buy a beautiful postcard and then went to VG’sdonuts for the best donuts I have had in my life. Their dought isso tender, so fluffy, and the glaze is just the right amount of sweetness. I highly recommendtheir plain glazed donuts. The other donuts are pretty good, but the plain glazed are absolutelythe top of the line at this shop. Do be careful about the time you visit them, though. They seemto take a midday break in baking, so you will either need to go before 11am or after school letsout. We got there at 2pm, so I had to settle for the only donut that was left…the powdered sugarcircle. They only take cards for transactions above $10 (that is a lot of donuts). Once we completethe donut run, we raced off for Five Guys…somewhere along the way. Turns out I forgot to geta second postcard, so we made an emergency stop in Dana Point for a postcard and Five Guys. Afterthat, we rushed back onto the 5 to try to get to the Hertz in Pasadena before closing at 6. We hadto take a couple of toll roads to make it back in time. Even with the benefit of the toll roads(something like a $7 charge), we barely made it to the Hertz in time. Google’s awful ETA systemkept pushing back the ETA as we were driving. The guy who arrived at the Hertz just after us hadthe doors locked on him by a disgruntled employee…. :0. The employee deliberately locked the doorsbehind him to prevent the rushed customer from getting into the store and placing a claim on hisright to be serviced. Well, that was the end of that. The weather in Pasadena that day was surprisingly hot…weburned for tens of minutes on the side of Colorado Blvd while we waited for our Uber to take usback to campus. There is much more to San Diego than what we were able to explore. LegoLand for the young ones, SeaWorld for everybody, Old Town SanDiego for the history buffs, all the museums in Balboa Park (there’ssomething for everybody), the Old Globe for theater and Shakespearebuffs, Torrey Pines for outdoors fans, La Jolla Cove for sea kayakingbuffs, the beaches for surfers, so on. San Diego is a pretty car-dependent city, but you can certainly take the Coaster or Amtrak and localbuses to get around…I just think you’ll find your transportation times getting jacked way up ifyou try to rely on public transport. Of course, downtown, you have the benefit of the scooters. Uber and Lyft are reliable and broadly used, so you don’t need a car, but I think you’ll find yourexperience much improved if you have a vehicle. Until next time. "

    "body": "2019/07/12 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Last year was midnight donuts. This year, learning from from how theprevious year’s experience on how saturating sugar can be, wassupposed to be ataco run. What went wrong? What went wrong was that I underestimated my ability to quicklymetabolise omakase…. no, that’s not the right way to say it…I wasstupid and ate a big meal before the tacos run. I went with two of the taco run adventurers for omakase at SushiKimagure Ike in Pasadena, near the gold line station. All three of us got the Hana option, which was a delightful mixture offish and soy sauce and rice (is this facetious enough?). No, really,for $90, the food is delightful. All I will say is that after onenight of sushi, my appetite for the Japanese delicacy is sated fora month. The owner of the store is very nice and likes to play jokes on hiscustomers. The store is small, so you may find it nice to place areservation. Do try to sit at the bar. That’s where you get the mostexperience out of being a sushi restaurant. One of the taco run sushi attendees was freaking out aboutthe US’s new requirement forsocial media information from visa applicants. Privacy is the new commodity. I reada brilliant article recently about the environment and how we workso hard to get back things we destroyed and how privacy is now in thesame category of depravity as the environment…cannot find it. Wouldgreatly appreciate if someone found it and sent the link to me…ona blog with a fish as the logo? Anyway, the taco run was abridged and we just went toPlancha Tacos in Venice. We chose thislocation because three of the five taco run attendees thought PlanchaTacos had the world’s best taco, in the form of their tiger shrimptaco ($4?). I’ve had this taco before, and while it is pretty tasty,I don’t think I can say that tacos are all that spectacular. Don’t getme wrong, I like tacos. I will go out of my way to find taco joints. But taco will never be a gourmet food. They’re always too dry, tooflavorless, too full of hard meat, too this too that to really bethe pinnacle of what I’ve put on my palette. "

    "body": "2019/07/05 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com For all you people using newfangled versions of iTunes that don’t allow easycreation of custom ringtones from songs you already have in your library.  Identify up to 35 second chunk of desired source song.   Right click on song in iTunes and click on “Show in Finder”  Right click on song in Finder and click “Open With” &gt; “QuickTimePlayer. App”  Click “Command - T” on keyboard when QuickTime opens to open up “Trimfunctionality. Or go to “Edit” &gt; “Trim” in upper left menu bar in QuickTime.  Drag the slider to capture the chunk of the song you want to use as yourringtone. You can hit trim in the upper right section of the window at anypoint to see what part of the song you have trimmed. Your changes will not bepermanently saved until you export the song, so you can trim as many times asnecessary.  A quick way to get the right chunk of song is to trim from thebeginning of the song first, until the length of the trimmed song equals thetime remaining on the song in iTunes when you move the slider to the desiredstart time. Then you can trim from the back to the desired length.  Once you are done trimming, click “File” &gt; “Export As” &gt; “Audio Only” inthe upper left hand menu of QuickTime App.   Save the song with whatever name you want, to whatever folder you desire. Remember where you save the song. To make things easy, you can save things toyour “Desktop” folder.   Now open the folder you just saved the song to and drag the song into youriTunes “Songs” library.   Click on the song in your iTunes library, click “File” &gt; “Convert” &gt;“Create AAC Version” in the upper left menu of iTunes App.   The newly created version will not be highlighted in iTunes. Right clickthe song that is not highlighted but has the same length as your ringtone,then click “Show in Finder” (it is best to rename this song so you do notconfuse it with the original song)  Drag this song into your “Tones” Folder (typically file path is: Macintosh HD⁩ ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨[username] ▸ ⁨Music⁩ ▸ ⁨iTunes⁩ ▸ ⁨iTunesMedia⁩ ▸ Tones) Change the name of the song from ***. m4a —&gt; ***. m4r. Click“Use . m4r” in the pop-up window.   Connect your device. You should see a “Tones” section appear under yourdevice name in iTunes. Drag the newly created ***. m4r file into this Tonessection. You should now be able to use the new ringtone. You can delete anyof the intermediate songs from your iTunes library. Update, July 7: Applescript for doing the above, except for step 13, ishere. "

    "body": "2019/07/04 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Here are some unorganized takeaways from myrecent trip to China with thealways excellent Signet Tours:  Shanghai is a highly uninteresting tourist city. It has the least historyout of the cities we visited. Thetourist destinations here were a skyscraper, the old streets of 城隍廟, anda jazz band (we didn’t actually go, but we were given tickets to the showin the Fairmont Peace Hotel).  Hangzhou, on the other hand, is a beautiful city. The lake is gorgeous anddefinitely worth a walk around and a ride through.  Note: If you are looking to buy good 綠豆糕, please save your money forwhatever brand they sell in Taipei Taoyuan International Airport. We triedsome from 采芝齋, a really famous brand in Suzhou, but it was certainly notworth the money.  The roads are of excellent quality, even in very rural or out of theway places, unlike roads in the US.  The Great Wall is in great shape. I’m not sure how much work has been doneon restoration, but the pieces we visited did not at all seem to be atrisk of collapsing anytime soon. Do be warned that there are certain sectionsof the Great Wall that are very steep or lack side walls (司馬台長城).  Do not ever travel to China or Japan in July or August. This is when the“plum rains” (梅雨) begin. You will suffer under high humidity and hightemperatures (40deg C +) that will make your clothes / food / soul rot.  Bejing, Xi’An, Huangshan, the other places on the Signet Tours itineraryare all definitely worth a visit. The history in Beijing and Xi’An isextraordinary (though I’m sure you’d already determined that from the sheerquantity of Chinese period dramas set within imperial China) and Huangshan isjust a beautiful place to visit. Do be advised that Huangshan is overcast orrainy for 2/3 of the year. There are lots of bugs on Huangshan, so pleasebring bug spray.  I did not like the food… Blame my Taiwanese palette? I did not expect to enjoy this trip as much as I did. My original desire wasto go to go Singapore and Malaysia and get fat. I suppose my body is happythat I didn’t go to Singapore, though my mind is not convinced it’s a bad ideato execute that plan at some point in the future. "

    "title": "Follow Up to Previous Post on Topics that Bother Me",
    "body": "2019/06/12 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I have always thought that history is an essential topic. History is not aboutmemorization of facts; it’s about understanding human nature and theinstitutions we have constructed to help manage human nature individually andcollectively. Of course, one could make just as borderline meaningless astatement like that for any other discipline. (The objective of mathematicsis not to…) Anyway, my point is that I think we need to pay more attentionto the origins of phenomenon and read the original documents that are thefoundation for the knowledge we take for granted today. For example, if youwant to understand the whole hullabaloo around evolution, you read Darwin’sOrigin of Species. If you want to understand modern economics, you would dowell to start with John Stuart Mill or Adam Smith. If you want to understandphysics, how about some Newton? Stand on giants’ shoulders all you want. I’mgoing to be busy asking them questions in the meantime. It is vitally important that we reexamine these culturally held beliefs andpoke at them, prod at them, do everything we can to show how we could believeagainst our current beliefs. What this exercise does is to strengthen our beliefs, to have us prove toourselves that the direction we are headed is still truly the right direction. Let us not proceed on blind faith that the conformist, mimetic solution orbelief is the right one. Here’s a quote from Feynman on exactly this topic:  Finally, with regard to this time-binding, a man cannot live beyond thegrave. Each generation that discovers something from its experience mustpass that on, but it must pass that on with a delicate balance of respectand disrespect, so that the [human] race–now that it is aware of thedisease to which it is liable–does not inflict its errors too rigidly onits youth, but it does pass on the accumulated wisdom, plus the wisdom thatit may not be wisdom. Here are some pieces of history I want to learn more about:  The history of feminism. My gut feeling is that feminism was started by thewomen who went to work during WWII and felt dissatisfied with the housewifelife after the war ended. These women upended the contemporary “wisdom” andpreference for women staying at home. Is it correct? How does one measure theimpact of introducing women into the workplace?     I have doubts about whether we could ever construct measurable results related to the commonly used measure of progress: GDP or economic or other money growth. How does one measure the growth in productivity from introducing more minorities into an office? How does one measure the growth in productivity related to having more women in power? One of my professors has a theory that matriarchal societies being more socially good than male-dominated societies.  Maybe I’m naive and stupid. If you think I’m wrong, confront me through email.     Evolution. Next on my reading list is Darwin’s Origin of Species. I’mexcited to hear the man himself talk about a simply revolutionary topic.  China. Being ethnically Chinese has given me only a sliver of an advantageover non-Chinese into the status of the country and the whole Communistfiasco. Xijinping is a calculating and exceptionally skilled leader. The USis not designed to handle leaders that think as long-term and as aggressivelyas people like Xijinping do. We are designed to adapt quickly. We place inchecks and balances like the four-year term and the Houses and the electoralcollege to prevent the tyranny of majority and political nonsense. We listento our citizens. Other countries don’t, and we will lose if we don’t shape upand start paying attention to China’s approach towards a kink in the growthcurve where they really start overtaking us.  Communism. It’s time to read Marx and Engels and the rest of the gang. Surely the modern tumult around socialist and communist ideals is not thefirst the world has seen. It’s not the first time that people have tried tosubjugate natural desires and natural quirks of “human nature” into a moreutopian format. It is not the first time that ideals have been corrupted andpulled away from the founders’ intentions.  AI Safety. We cannot be distracted by low level nuisances like fake newsor babble orcat videos. But how do we make progress without sabotaging ourselves?As time goes on, this list will grow. As time goes on, I hope to have morerecommendations on information sources I can feed off of to fill my knowledgegaps on these topics. As time goes on, I will[face more issues with evaluating the legitimacy of text] (https://medium. com/@NPCollapse/gpt2-counting-consciousness-and-the-curious-hacker-323c6639a3a8). But wait, that’s not just a me problem. It’s a society problem. Happy reading and learning and almost start of summer. "

    "title": "Mental Bookmark June 2019: Topics that Bother Me Because I Don't Know Much About Them",
    "body": "2019/06/06 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com The takeaways from this mental bookmark on my models of the world on June 6, 2019 are:  I need to up my open-mindedness.  I need to up my empathy.  I have a lot to learn. These topics are listed in order of how much they bother me.  Feminism     I have never been inclined to call myself a feminist because I have always felt like the movement just a bunch of women whining about how unfair the world is. I also feel like feminists are deliberately polarizing people who jump at the notion of any mention of vaguely controversial statements like “men and women are fundamentally different”.    I don’t feel like I’ve been particularly subject to any gender based discrimination from people who’ve mattered. Those who have made stupid comments have basically been pushed to the sidelines of my life. I have made progress around those people asinine enough to think they could use petty comments to sabotage my attempts at success.    Call me privileged and lucky all you want. I will not deny that I have had life pretty good so far. I will not deny that my opinion about #metoo and related feminist movements will change if I ever am assaulted or seiously punished for not being male. But I feel like focusing on past mistakes and repeating the issue a million times is not going to resolve the issue. It just makes people feel uncomfortable and sad and wonder if they actually are being discriminated against. This woman captures my feelings pretty well. I want to say that focusing on these issues detracts from progress, but progress is a nebulous concept.    There are so many ways to make mistakes but only so many ways to make things right. Focusing on the ways to do things right is simply more efficient.    I am looking for people on Twitter to follow regarding feminism because I think it’s a topic that I should at least resolve my ignorance about. I still think my time is better spent on advancing my career or doing things that make me healthy, wealthy, and wise, but perhaps the common quips about being more open-minded are finally starting to drill their way through my skull.     Politics and Law     This is a whole grabbag of things but basically I’m interested in learning more about the structure of human societies.     Racial Discrimination     My feelings on this are similar to my feelings on feminism. I have never experienced discrimination in a meaningful way, so I am not super sympathetic to any complaints on this front. I am also wary of any kind of Asian worshipping that comes out of the mouths of people like Munger (sorry, cannot find good link to any quotes, but you can look up his thoughts on BYD or Li Lu and Chinese people in general).    What in the world is wokeness?    Taxes and Personal Wealth Management     I don’t know how much I’ve spoken about this topic before, but I still think becoming financially independent is a priority. The best way to become financially independent while still living nicely is to invest. I’m still too dumb to take any serious interest in the stock market, so this objective will have to wait a bit.    In the meantime, I need to learn how to properly budget and manage my post-college expenses.    To repeat, the takeaways from this mental bookmark on my models of the world on June 6, 2019 are:  I need to up my open-mindedness.  I need to up my empathy.  I have a lot to learn. Ping me with suggestions on how to improve, books on how to expand my worldview, criticisms of my worldview. "

    "title": "Memorial Day in Santa Monica and Venice",
    "body": "2019/05/28 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I spent Memorial Day in Santa Monica and Venice with a good friend. We leftCaltech around 10am and headed straight for Santa Monica pier. The pastcouple of times I’ve come to the pier were around midnight, so I wasdefinitely surprised by the daytime activity. We immediately headed up fromsea level to the surface streets. We did a loop around the 3rd StreetPromenade then grabbed morning drinks atEspresso Cielo. I got a hot chocolate, and he gotsome kind of cold latte. The cafe has a very nice vibe to it and has massivepastries (croissant, cheese danish, etc). After drinks, we did another lapand a half around the promenade (up to 4th then back down Santa Monica Blvd)before stopping for lunch at Cava. I’d seen a bunch ofpeople at the Pasadena Cava on Lake but had not tried it, so I was ready tobe surprised. The food is expensive, at $12 for a bowl, but it’s super tasty. Of course, the more you eat, the better the deal is. I saw some guy pack hisbowl almost twice as high as the container with vegetables and (unlimited)toppings. I got falafel and chicken on a bed of arugula. Would highlyrecommend if you’re into these kind of health food dishes. After lunch, we walked Ocean Ave towards the Palisades Park. We saw a guyflying a kite down at the water front and some plane dragging around a Pepsiadvertisement. We stopped once we got to 101 Ocean Avenue. We stopped to take agander at the ocean view from101 Ocean Avenue(condo residences) and watched some pickle ball players down on at sea level. On our way back, we each snagged a Bird scooter and zipped down to VeniceBeach. I initially felt pretty unstable on the Bird scooter. The fear vanishedwithin a minute or two of using the scooter, though. We happily zoomed alongthe bike lane, melding in seamlessly with car and pedestrian bike traffic. We stopped zooming along once we got to Market Street x Pacific Avenue. We ended our Bird rides then walked onto the famous Venice speedway. Our first sight? A man trying toride a 7’ unicycle and juggle knives. Apparently that guy is out on the speedway every day. We walked along thespeedway for a while, simply soaking in the activity and vibrancy of the road. We saw some police on horses. Wealso made it to muscle beach! Our lastsight before we headed off to see the canals wasthis mural. The canals of Venice were originally built to drain the marshland. Now theyserve as a beautiful neighborhood in which to take some photos and peek intoother people’s expensive backyards. One lady was very upset that someone hadstolen her decorative bird feeder and posted a pointed sign saying that thethief could “rot in hell”. The woman who presumably wrote the sign wasstanding outside, watering her plants, so I would have brought some seriousfire and brimstone upon myself by taking a photo of it. Here is a pictureof the canal. We were super thirsty at this point, having not taken water since lunch. Wedecided to stop at the Thai restaurant at the south end of the canals forsome Thai iced tea. This was way too sweet for me, so I drank less than halfof it. After the drink, we went to check out the Venice skate park. This wasa super cool place. I really dig people who can throw their weight around ona board. I’ve been tempted to buy a board since 5th grade, when I convinceda friend to “teach” me how to ride. That was a scary experience that basicallywas as aggressive as teaching someone to swim by pushing them into the deepend. I’ve messed around with long boards since but have not pulled the triggerfor my own board yet. Boards are cool, but you’ll really be surprised when you turn around and seethe people rollerskating in a coned off area behind the skate park. Theseguys are brilliant. Somebody’s doing pirouettes in a corner. Another coupleis executing some tight choreography to whatever is blasting out of the boombox. Some other guys are just messing around. Rollerskating is basicallyice skating on concrete. At this point, I needed to find a quite place to take mycoffeechat. app call. This is an app that matchesinformation seekers with information givers. Today, I was seeking informationon street design from Daniel, an Australian transport engineer. We had anenjoyable 10 minute call about Jan Gehl and new urbanism and walkability incities. The app automatically connects you and your partner and automaticallycuts you off at 10 minutes, no warning. You can always schedule another callor chat with them in the app, but perhaps 10 minutes was really enough time. After the chat, we talked about travel. He wants to travel to all countriesin the world, going at least to the capital city and to one or two suburbs toget food. I have technically been to quite a few countries in the world, butI wouldn’t really say I’ve actually been there. I don’t know how to properlytravel, but I think I’m looking forward to a bunch of good years of travelingwith friends (once I find the right ones). A side note. I think travelling between places is inhuman. Sitting in a metalcan that is dry and full of recirculated germ air for hours on end isphysically stressful. Time changes are physically stressful. Waiting in theairport is physically stressful. All these things make travel hard, not tomention how stressful it is to get a good itinerary set up and actually dothe things on the itinerary. But, if you’re a good control freak or if you’rewilling to listen to a good control freak, the itinerary part can be made mucheasier. As to making the actual sitting in a metal can part easier, buy alounge pass, get first class seats, do all those things to make it morepalatable. It’s sad that affordable travel is so expensive, but you do whatyou need to do to get the experiences you need to grow. After chatting about travel, we decided to get dinner at Hotel Erwin, next toEggslut. Our first attempt to get to the restaurant led us to therooftop bar. I got a nice photo out ofit, but it wasn’t where we wanted to be. The bar was super popular that day,too, so seats were exceedingly hard to come by. We headed back downstairs tothe actual restaurant and each had their OG burger. My friend has beenvegetarian his whole life, and this was his second time having a burger. There were no surprises with his burger, but it’s not like I was expectinganything. I don’t think switching to meat or switching to vegetarianism isthat life-changing. Food is still food. The changes are all biochemical andinternal. I think I’m going to cut back on meat consumption. I need to eat more plantsand don’t need that much protein in my diet. After dinner, we headed back home. It was a fun (not exhausting, actually) dayand we’re looking forward to round 2 before I graduate. Yesterday was honestly the kind of day where I realize that I don’t actuallyhate LA. I just hate Pasadena and its lack of variety and options andsuburban-ness. Pasadena is a bike-friendly city, but the lack of other activityseriously dampens the bike-ability benefit. I love the craziness of Venice andthe beach vibe of Santa Monica because where else are you going to find suchgreat weather and such insane culture? San Diego beaches are way too laidback. Most beaches in SD don’t have the kind of infrastructure Santa Monicahas. There are definitely no beaches that I can think of that haveVenice-style madness. SF Bay Area? Do they even have beaches? Maybe Santa Cruzis their one saving grace. But I’m pretty sure Malibu has Santa Cruz handilybeat for surfing. I think LA is still the place to be if you love this blendof individual expression and good weather and awesome food. You’ve just got tolive near the coast. That’s it for now.

    "title": "Blame vs. Accountability",
    "body": "2019/05/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com A friend recently asked me what the difference was between blaming peopleand holding them accountable. My answer: Nobody signs up for blame. Done. End of story. eom More seriously, nobody signs up to cause the department to lose $100m inrevenue in 2018. Nobody signs up to forget to turn off the car headlights anddrain the battery. Nobody signs up to forget to close the house windows on anight when it rains and cause the house to get flooded. Blame is a harmful and destructive emotional reaction to negative stressors. It is natural to want to determine causality. It is natural to not want tohave to deal with negative consequences. It is not helpful to assign thatcausality to agents that are independent of the result. What is helpful is to hold people accountable for what they signed up for. “Bob, you were responsible for helping us close that $10m deal with ABCPlastics. What’s the status?” “Emily, we agreed on meeting at 6pm. We waiteduntil 6:30pm before you showed up. We really enjoy hanging out with you, butthis relationship is not going to work if you cannot show respect for ourtime. ” “Yeah, you apparently didn’t put one of the new cover sheets on yourTPS reports? … Did you see the memo about this?” The objective of holding people accountable is to establish a social contractof respect. The more you enforce accountability and your principles regardinghow you want to be treated, the more you will be respected. So…go out thereand make the world a better place. "

    "title": "I Had Racist Sheep in Minecraft",
    "body": "2019/05/20 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com This story is old. It’s from my high school days, when I downloadedMineshafter to see what the Minecraft craze wasall about. I am sad that I don’t have any pictures of my time in Mineshafter,because it would really have lifted my spirits to see that house and farm Icreated. It would also have made for a more compelling post. The situation is that I had fenced in a bunch of sheep. They were next tomy utterly massive pens of cows and chickens. Despite my efforts to resizethe pens, the sheep kept wanting to escape. I don’t remember why I came uponthe idea to separate the sheep by color, but that was the solution. Blacksheep in a corner. Browns in another. Whites in the remaining space. No moreescaping sheep. The escaping sheep phenomenon revived itself once I started breeding them. A black and brown sheep could produce a brown. The black parent would notwant to be in the same pen as its brown child. I guess the parent-child bondis not strong in Minecraft sheep. I stopped playing Minecraft a while ago because it would make me supermotion sick. Around that time, I also found myself getting motion sick fromTwilight Princess on Wii. I would often try to push through the nausea, whichonly resulted in my having to spend 30min - 1hr laying on the ground or couch,waiting for my body to equilibrate. I haven’t played many video games sincehigh school. I tried playing Mineshafter again a couple of months ago. The motion sicknesscame on very quickly this time (&lt;20min). I immediately deleted the app. Ihaven’t touched the game since, though I do want to recreate some versionof that very first world I inhabited, even if it did have racist sheep. I guess I can only safely play games likeTetris. "

    "title": "Night Cross Country",
    "body": "2019/05/15 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I completed my night cross country and checked off the rest of my nightflight requirements on Mon, 5/13. The plan for that day was to watch bothKCMA and KAPV to see which destination we would try to hit. KCMA, and therest of the coast were seeing some aggressively low ceilings, so we decidedto head to the clear and unwindy Apple Valley for the evening. Well, the decision was not quite that easy. Technically, ceilings and all thatjazz were looking ok when I did reviewed the1800WxBrief. By the time I got to KEMT andactually looked outside, I realized that there was haze surrounding themountains. There was also an AIRMET for MOD turbulence from SFC to 12000’. No PIREPs on turbulence, though, so who knows what was actually going on. Clouds seemed to be forming a nice ceiling in the west, so there was apossibility that we might not be able to make it back. I also had passengers,who would have had a say in whether we turned around for sake of turbulenceor anything else. We felt like the risks were not severe enough to stop us from attempting thetrip, so we pre-flighted and took off towards the first of severalcheckpoints: KPOC. The full list was: KEMT –&gt; KPOC –&gt; VPLCC –&gt; (follow the15 freeway into the mtns) –&gt; VPLCP –&gt; KAPV. So far so good. No turbulence,no unwanted weather, just a bit of traffic that we were being asked tostay below 5000’ for. Our target altitude was 7500, which would give usplenty of margin over the mountains. VPLCC passed by with no issue, then we“took” the 15 up towards VPLCP. We were passed off to Joshua Approach atsome point over the mountains. They asked us to get weather info at KAPV andthen just shooed us off the frequency. There was no other traffic in the area. Welcome to the high desert. You can get automated weather at KAPV by sendingthree clicks to the CTAF. We deviated east of VPLCC towards Apple Valley after being dropped by JoshuaApproach. Apple Valley’s only lit runway is 18/36. They do have a beacon, butthat beacon is stuffed among the rest of the lights at the airport, so I didn’tsee it until I got very close. What I was relying on to navigate was the GPSand the big, bright tower just to the east and north of the airport. We entered left traffic for 18. At this point, for whatever reason, therunway lights started flashing. My instructor desperately tried to turn themback on, trying combos of 4, 5, and 7 clicks. This is one of those momentswhen I realized how important sight was. The moment the runway lights wentoff, all my notions of distance and glideslope flew out the window. I wasactually, 100% blind. We finally got the lights back on (7 clicks, I think)and landed smoothly. We taxiied to the only exit off the runway and thenfollowed the blue taxiiway lights to the runway area. I think a CHP airplanewas also using KAPV. We were the only two in the area. After takeoff, we asked for some data on weather south of the mountains fromflight services on 122. 2. Ceilings were low over Brackett (just over 2000’ BKN)but otherwise clear. We would soon see what this ceiling actually meant. Before we returned to KEMT, we made a stop at KONT. This was my firstexperience landing at a class C airport. SoCal had us set up to follow ahuge United jet (I think it was United) for landing on RW 26L. They came inhigh and had to perform some S-turns to get down to altitude. Once we weretransferred over to KONT tower, they had us move to 26R. We executed a stopand go on their massive, 2mi+ long runway, making sure to land past thejet’s touchdown point and thus avoid their wake turbulence. After takeoff,we were handed back to SoCal (by choice) and began our westward departure. This was when we started to see the clouds. To be frank, I don’t think Iregistered that I was seeing clouds. My instructor started to make somestatements about clouds and how we couldn’t see certain things. I just feltlost…(this is one of those flights where I sometimes can feel the limits ofmy ability and sometimes have the sign of my limits fly over my head…dangerous). Only after we started to get really close to the clouds did myinstructor point out the 210, which is when my understanding of localgeography meshed a bit better. The clouds were nice and black, which is whyI didn’t distinguish them from the rest of the pitch black terrain. It wasn’t reasonable for us to get back home under VFR so my instructor set upa VOR-A approach to KEMT. I had already had some experience maintainingheading and (blindly) following SoCal’s heading instructions under IMC, soI took care of the actual flying. Once we got to KEMT and out of the clouds,I took another minute to get vaguely reoriented with the beacon and runway 19. We set up for right traffic on 19, crossing over midfield and directly enteringdownwind. Landing was uneventful. Overall, the trip was successful. It was scary and mesmerizing to only seethe terrain as a black mass. I also misinterpreted wingtip lights on anaircraft on the taxiway as runway or misc. airport lights, which would havebeen dangerous had my instructor not intercepted and told me to turn torunup. Night flight is definitely fun because the views are spectacular. Theair also tends to be smoother and cooler, making the ride more enjoyable. Butit will definitely be a while before I get my night vision and skills up to apoint where I can do things like this on my own. Questions, comments? Email me atipacifics@gmail. com. "

    "body": "2019/05/09 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com It’s been a long time since I’ve last posted something here. It’s not that Ihaven’t had any interesting thoughts; it’s more that I’ve been swamped tryingto read House of Leavesor researchingcar-free cities orTweeting aboutflight experiencesor …eh, you can just read my Twitter. Ifyou want some of my thoughts or debriefs on what Caltech’s super interestingintro political science prof has said during lecture, email or DM me. The main point of today’s topic is 14 CFR §61. 109. A. 3:  3 hours of flight training in a single-engine airplane on the control andmaneuvering of an airplane solely by reference to instruments, includingstraight and level flight, constant airspeed climbs and descents, turns to aheading, recovery from unusual flight attitudes, radio communications, andthe use of navigation systems/facilities and radar services appropriate toinstrument flight; Up until this point, I’d only done basic instrument under the hood, overPasadena (Santa Fe Practice Area). Those experiences were controlled, mentally straining but otherwiselow stress, and were interspersed with VFR maneuvers that “purged” me ofany bad habits related to staring at the instrument panel. Today’s experience was much more real-world. We flew from KEMT to KCNO,following ILS procedures. Ceiling today was low: 2000’ BKN and 3500’ OVC, so I probably could havegone without the hood. We flew the TEC (tower en route control) route to KCNO,which is a relatively simple, canned route. We departed RW1, which is normalfor KEMT because of KLAX’s airspace looming over RW19 departures. DepartingRW19 means KEMT has to communicate with KLAX and try to find a way to get usC172’s and Piper Cherokee’s out among the 737’s and A380s and so on. First thing’s first, we told KEMT’s tower that we wanted to fly IFR to KCNO,they came with back with CRAFT:  Clearance Limit (typically destination airport) Route Altitudes Frequencies Transponder SettingWe were cleared to KCNO (Chino Airport, near Ontario – KONT) for an obstacledeparture procedure (the most common IFR release I’ve heard for practicetrips out of KEMT). We were told to follow (?) go to (?) Paradise VOR (sorry,my memory of this is bad. I’m not super familiar with IFR clearance terms) at3000’ but expecting 5000’. 125. 5 for Socal Approach and 5264 Squawk code. All very palatable information, some of it filtered through my instructor andhis handy-dandy (probably) Foreflight powered iPad. After takeoff on RW1,we climbed to 700’ MSL before turning towards the 098 for Paradise. We turnedto a higher heading than 098 to begin with, because we were north of 098. SoCal gave us a couple of intermediate instructions for different altitudesand headings to maintain, and up until 200 feet above the runway, I did nottake my hood off. It was extremely disorienting to see 26R just appear,exactly as planned, with us flying along a glideslope that was also doingit’s job of getting us to the ground smoothly. We did a full stop landing and then got ready for the TEC route back to KEMT. KEMT uses VOR-A approach from POM (Pomona Alpha), so we were told to maintainheading 260 until we intersected with V363 (Victor airway 363). Once on V363,we could follow POM direct to KEMT. KCNO’s ILS is nicer than KEMT’s because it takes you to 200ft above therunway, perfect for low visibility conditions. KEMT’s only takes you topattern altitude, 1000’ AGL. Again, I didn’t take off my hood until I wasat the end of the ILS, 1000’ above the runway, cleared to cross over thefield from East to West and enter right traffic for RW19. After the second landing, we did three more landings. One soft field, whichis basically just keeping the nose high after touchdown. On actualsoft fields, you may even want to keep power on or put on power aftertouchdown to maintain momentum. Then we did two short field landings. Wealso asked for a light gun demonstration, which, to my surprise, worked. Wesaw a bright green light (LED) shining at us out of the tower when we enteredfinal. I was surprised because my instructor made it seem like the lightswere highly ineffective and the ATC’s ability to aim the light at us wasnearly nonexistent. Short field landings require a precision of 200ft beyonda chosen touchdown point. At KEMT, the distance from RW19’s displacedthreshold to exit point Charlie is 400’, so make sure you touch down wellbefore then, and no sooner than the threshold. How was today’s experience? A bit nerve wracking. The first couple of minutes,I was struggling to maintain heading. There was a lot of yawing left andright, but thankfully I trimmed the plane pretty ok so not a lot of pitchoscillation. This amount of movement, combined with my tendency to sometimescombine yaw and pitch, did cause me a bit of motion sickness. It was no issue,just a mild feeling of being unwell after I landed at KCNO. The rideback was much smoother, though we got a bit of the cloud turbulence we avoidedon the way to KCNO. Overall, this was a great use of the cloudy weather. I have about 1. 6 morehours of instrument flight needed. I wouldn’t say I’m looking forward tobeing under the hood, but I do now have a greater appreciation for whatcommercial airline pilots do every day.

    "title": "How I Chose Among Job Offers, Fall 2018",
    "body": "2019/04/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com This is a piece meant to document what I consider to be a pretty rational and successful decision-making process that occured during the Fall / Winter of 2018. At the time, I was debating among several offers from software shops in the Bay. I had, at this point, narrowed it down to three companies, which I will call A, B and C. Company A is your standard large tech company. I was offered my choice of team within the company and was given a standard compensation package. Given my strong preference for working in startups, I was already inclined to reject this offer. Company B is a startup with somewhere between 50 - 70 people. It’s tackling a fundamentally hard and interesting problem but will never achieve the scale or recognition or fanfare that FB did. It was a Thiel investment, which made me happy. Company C is a startup with around 300 people. It has already raised a Series D fund and was founded by ex-Google, Microsoft, and Oracle engineers. Their approach to their perceived industry problem was the best approach I’d heard so far. I think they were actually solving the core issue, rather than doing what most other “competitiors” were doing and developing auxiliary tooling. The final showdown was really between companies B and C. I left company A on the docket mostly because it was a safety choice. It was something that others would approve of but definitely not an option I would be proud of myself for taking. What was the difference between companies B and C? Company C had a better culture. The people were more engaged, they were more interested in pulling me onto the team, they were more engaging, and they told me immediately after all the interviews that they wanted to extend me an offer. The main issue with company B was that the engineers on my future team were pushing the responsibility of convincing me to join the company onto the Head of Hiring and Culture. I felt like, with the exception of the Head of Hiring and Culture, the team was very lukewarm about my joining them. Maybe this is a fault of people being bad at expressing themselves. Maybe this is my just misreading some signals. But that was a major reason I chose company C over company B. Another reason I chose company C was because some people who had helped company B recruit for the previous year’s season felt that company B was slowing down. They weren’t looking as aggressively for new candidates, weren’t posed for growth, were pretty much not the place to be as a young, earnest software engineer looking for a rocket ship to strap herself to. I can not downplay the anguish I went through to make this decision. I felt that company B was delivering a more revolutionary product. I felt so much resonance with the pain that company B was solving. I knew that’s why people at company B were there. They had first-hand experience with thepain and wanted to push forward the industry to the new century. I was also charmed by the fact that some of the members on the team had taken leaves of absences from university to join the team. It was a superficially Thiel-esque feeling. I said above that I think company C’s approach is more correct and more exciting and more impactful than that of other startups in the space. I still think that is true. Another conclusion I made, with maybe 60% confidence, was that company C’s market was larger and that my payoff would thus be more worthwhile. I still think that is true. Another note is that company B was offering less than company A or C, in stock or in base salary. This fit with my assumption that company B had fundamentally less market to capitalize on. In fact, the interesting thing to me is that at some point, if company B does their job really well, they’ll work build themselves out of their jobs. That’s a funny but fantastic position to be in. I know some people were complaining that GSK or some other major pharma company had basically done the same thing. Their drugs were so effective that they cured their market. I think it’s great to be in thatposition, where your work is that effecitve. I think my decision to join company C aligned with my priorities, in order, of people, growth, and projects. I met great people at both company B and C but the people at C wanted me more. They were more excited about their projects, about mentoring me, about enabling their customers. Company B and C are both on track to achieve great growth, but C simply had more to gain. The projects at C were of greater interest to me. Writing this post has brought up some feelings of regret and pain that I didn’t join company B. People who were close to the company B team that were superficially involved in helping me make the decision were sad that I didn’t choose B. I felt sad that I acted against my resonance with company B’s mission. I don’t think my decision was wrong, but it’s been an emotional rollercoaster to review my decision-making process. I guess it just shows that I still don’t have a super strong north star to follow. My internal compass is still wavering, waiting for a strong magnetic field to push it into alignment. We’ll see what happens with everything once I start work. I have time, I hope, to catch up with everybody that helped me throughout the process and to build a stronger model for what I should be doing with my life. "

    "title": "Getting Back on Twitter",
    "body": "2019/04/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I joined Twitter in April 2014. I can’t exactly remember why high school me thought this was a meaningful thing to do. In fact, I was so ashamed and bored by my old tweets that I deleted them all. Maybe I should have left that internet paper trail to inform me about my high school years. Regardless, I don’t think my Twitter usage really picked up until I got to Caltech. At some point, I was working for Scoutables on social media promotion. That got me a follow from Fred Claire, former Dodgers general manager, and an excuse to check Twitter to figure out the trends in the baseball world on any given week. I believe, around that time, I was also experimenting with figuring out how to Tweet Cool Things. I ended up following over 150 people and tweeting a bunch of drivel about random links I found interesting on the Internet. This coincided with my attempts to do the same thing on Facebook, for personal reasons and for the Global Goddess / Kanberra Gel campaigns. That kind of tweeting was largely a failure. I actually didn’t even like that many of the people I was following, I wasn’t saying anything particularly insightful, and I somehow didn’t realize that being a link posting bot was not exciting to people. This period of exploring the Internet like a fiend overlaps with the period of time when I would obsessively subscribe to and try to keep up with newsletters. I subscribedto so many newsletters that I had to create a rule to filter them away from my inbox in Mail. That mailbox, at its peak, grew to something like 800 messages, all from internet newsletters. Most of these newsletters were actually exceedingly boring to me. But I refused to give up and would wastea lot of time on weekends catching up on old news. Sometime in my junior year or post-sophomore summer, I wisened up and cut back on the newsletters. I also started blogging around that time. Now, it’s not like I had anything particularly smart to say; I just felt like I had more smart and substantial things to say that I previously did. I don’t think that assessment has been false, and I hope you readers are seeing improvement in this blog. That moment when I cleared out my inbox and started blogging again really changed something fundamental about my thinking and life. I can’t describe it concretely, but I think I feel like I’ve made yet another leap and bound in my world perspective as a result of that shift. Here’s some life improvements I attribute to that shift:  I put up a whiteboard on the wall in my room, on which I write project ideas, inspirational quotes, a todo list, etc. This whiteboard has been a great way for me to offload my mental world and view it more objectively.  I began to think seriously about procrastination and my work habits and digital distractions.  I began to more seriously refine my thoughts about city design and the ideal life and relationships and financial independence and meaning of work and priorities.  I began carrying around physical notebooks, onto which I could take noteswhile people watching or copy down quotes from reading materials or songwrite or draw.  I started to explore and document exotic projects, like playing the harmonica, and, to a smaller extent, flying.  I started documenting my life. This maybe sounds trivial, but it’s going to prove to be a huge boon for me to be able to look back and reflect on my old thinkings and old decision making processes. There’s a reason documentation is so important to experimentalists. How else do you know what you did? This implies that I see my life as an experiment, which I think is a half-baked analogy. We don’t have controls in life, no repeatability, bad documentation (history), bad practices which result in a tendency for falseness to propagate (fake news, conspiracy theories), etc.  I’m less confused about my life. There was a point in my Caltech career where I was considering, on a scale of 1 - 10, a level 5 of applying to the Studenski Award. This Award is supposed to help students who are at a crossroads figure out what to do with their lives. I would have used the Studenski money to help me figure a way out of software, which I didn’t want to “end up in”. I’ve since resolved my fear of becoming a software engineer and existing among that technical crowd working on robotics projects and taking up flying. I’m not done blowing away this cloud of uncertainty that surrounds who I “really am” and what I “really want to do”, but for now, this path provides me enough happiness that I know I can make it to the next juncture. The one thing I am still confused and stressed about is achieving financial independence. But I know that will come in time and through a bit more research. All those life and personal improvements and David Perrell’s recommendation to use Twitter as a way to maximize serendipity convinced me that I should get back on Twitter. I also recently read a couple of cool Twitter threads. Those also helped convince me that Twitter was a medium I could successfully use to propagate some of the“what I think is common knowledge but actually is just me” thoughts that I have. So, here it is, my Twitter page. I think the switch to 280 chars limit has also really helped me, because the pseudo long form tweet thread is what I think my natural style is. Building off my previous (failed and awful and let’s not talk about it too much) experience with Twitter, I know that people don’t just want to see a bunch of links from me. If I have links to share, I need to provide context, background, reasoning, the meat of how I see the world and why this matters. Maybe one day I’ll master the art of tweeting short, funny anecdotes about “oh I did this dumb hilarious thing today, teehee”. As usual, I am open to email inquiries (see email at top of post). And now that I am back on Twitter, I am open to the Twitter DM. Happy reading. "

    "body": "2019/04/14 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I started on the path of reading smart peoples’ open questions pages byclicking on the Hacker Newsletter link to Patrick Collison’sopen questions page. For anyone who keeps up with HN and the newsletter, you’ll probably realizehow behind I am on the issues. I love the content but during the school yearI only have time to shove newsletters into a mailbox on my Mac and read themon breaks. I didn’t realize who Collison was when I clicked the link. I’d completelyforgotten that I’d read his brilliant advice page and hisawesome Farnam Street interview. This questions page only reinforced my viewof Patrick as an immensely accomplished and smart person. I’ll definitely begoing through the rest of his website. Patrick’s very first question caught my eye because my dad has mentioned ittwo me twice in the recent past. Construction, education, and healthcare arethe three industries that have experienced the greatest inflation over thepast 5 decades. I think the response to this question by Arnold Kling is also pretty good. Kling’s thesis is one that prices increase where demand outstrips supply. Sure, that’s basic economics. But why does there seem to be a lack ofaccompanying quality improvements to these fields? Why does education now cost$70k+ and healthcare something else extravagant and construction still take10 years and $10mil over budget to get completed? The other half of Kling’sanswer is that we overprice these things based on hope. We hope that educationwill improve ourselves or our kids but we do it more for the status. We hopethat all the effort and time with doctor’s and money spent on collagen andBotox injections and etc will cure us of aging and cancer and diabetes and etc. We falsely hope in these things which are, frankly, late-stage interventions. And do you know what the success rate of late-stage interventions is?Drastically less than the success of early-stage interventions. So invest inyourself and you kids while they’re young and take care of your body whenyou’re young. The final point that Kling makes is that every industry is incentivized tojack up demand and restrict supply. Some poignant examples are encouragingpeople to get health insurance while restricting the number of licensedhospitals and encouraging subsidies for yoga therapy while inflating therequirements for a yoga license. I think we’re all, as Kling concluded, abit willfully ignorant about the issues in these industries. It’s going totake some exorbitant amount of effort to change these things, to make themfulfill a different set of drawbacks and desires (The Evolution of Useful Things. We’d rather not open that Pandora’s Box. Patrick links to a bunch of other people’s open Q’s pages so you’ll haveplenty to read for the coming week. I think I’ll reopen my questions page…once I think of some better questions. "

    "body": "2019/04/14 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Whew, I made it! After 36. 2 hours of training, I was cleared to do my firstcompletely unsupervised solo. The lesson just before my first unsupervisedsolo, I went over steep turns and stalls and then headed out to Brackettairport. I decided that I would go to Brackett on my own. Getting to Brackett was pretty easy. I set up the GPS to give me straight linedistance to KPOC and then set off with the appropriate frequencies on standby. We were using runway 19 that day, so I asked for an east (left crosswind)departure. Winds were fairly calm that day, max of 4kts in any direction. I called in to Brackett and was given right traffic on 26L. I aimed for theVOR on my way in and executed a rather uncoordinated turn. The nose was pointedto the left and I somehow couldn’t get it corrected before I landed. Thelanding was a bit rough. I did a full stop and then taxied back for anotherround of pattern work, hoping that this I could execute better on the secondtry. Not much luck. I decided to stay at KPOC and do pattern work for the day. Why was I landing so poorly? Well, let’s first consider that my instructorweighs a decent amount (something around 10% of gross aircraft weight). Theplane thus feels exceedingly floaty without him next to me. The balance alsogets completely thrown off. I think I was also suffering from a bit of nervesand stress from trying to remember everything I was supposed to do and whichairport tower I was talking to (Brackett, not El Monte ~). Another stress factor was the relatively high amount of traffic at Brackett. At some point, I was asked to switch to right traffic. We were using lefttraffic on 26L, for reasons that should be obvious if you look at the airportchart. I was also asked to squawk something other than 1200 from then on. I preferred 26L but they were assuming I was going to use 26R so there was abit of urgency in the controller’s voice when he told me to turn base for 26L. 26L is longer and wider than 26R. I wanted that additional margin on Friday. One thing I almost messed up on was making too wide of a final turn. 26L and26R are very close together, which means I should have been angling a bitsharper on my final turn so as to not interfere with aircraft on 26R. Therewas not much traffic on 26R, though. I figure the controllers were payingattention. I did 7 landings at Brackett that day. I then asked for a straight outdeparture so I could go to the Santa Fe practice area and hopefully find someplace to do one steep turn or stall in. Unfortunately, traffic was horrendous. Somebody coming up from the south crossed over Huntington gardens and thenstopped over the 210 near the Santa Anita racetrack about 1000ft below me andthere were lots of other people fairly close by. Turbulence was also pickingup so I figured I’d be safer just heading back to KEMT. My 8th and finallanding at KEMT was also not very well executed. I came in too slow and metthe ground at a higher speed than I would have liked to. Well, that was quite the adventure. My next unsupervised solo is on Wed. Iplan to do some work on steep turns and stalls that day. "

    "body": "2019/04/08 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I decided a few weeks back that I wanted my computer to be a more distration-free work tool. I wanted to be able to immerse myself in my work and not be concerned with stupid banner notifications telling me that somebody had sent me an email or that I had a meeting coming up or that Spotify was changing the song. So I got rid of those. But there was one more obnoxious resident of my menu bar that kept catching the corner of my eye and making me unncessarily distracted: the time. I have gone through many phases of being unnecessarily distracted by things in my life. At some point it was Internet-based Flash games. Another time it was Messenger notifications. Another time it was Reddit. Another time it was my email. This clock thing, though, has always been insidiously gnawingaway at my consciousness. I would constantly glance at it and do calculations for how much longer I had before my next class or appointment. (For those who like knowing how long until their next meeting, install Next Meeting. ) So I decided to stop. I got rid of the clock. All that’s left in the upper right hand corner of my Mac and center of the menu bar of my Ubuntu machine is the date in Month Day, Year format. The big question now is whether this had made any difference in my life. I think so. Psychologically, I feel much more at ease when I have to do long periods of writing work on my computer. I have a reasonable internal clock and memory of my meetings for a given day, so I’ll only check the time when I feel like I’m getting close to an event. Honestly, I’m not sure why I didn’t do this earlier. I don’t think there’s anything particularly profound about my decision to stop using a clock on my computer. I think it’s merely another measure I’ve decided to take against the digital infilatration of my mind and erosion of my attention span. "

I realized that my grasp of basic algorithms had seriously declined since I’d stopped taking CS courses and doing software-heavy work. The realization drilled a brief burst of fear into my consciousness, as I realized that algorithms and most of the foundational, first-principlestype things I’d learned in my engineering courses were exactly those pieces of knowledge with long-half lives.

When do you give up?     Bezos’ letter gives a pretty good start to this question by forcing you to distinctly describe what you are trying to achieve and to place a time table on your desired achievement.     Never give up on a dream because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.  Work on things that make you happy, regardless of what other people say about them.  Figure out the price of success and pay it.  Don’t get distracted by people who are playing a different game from you. (I have a post about this, but I somehow keep needing to remind myself of this. ) How you live each day is how you live your life.  Optimize for relationships. Choose the opportunities that will maximize your likelihood of building lasting, meaningful relationships (e. g. college) because people are everything.  Optimize for happiness. The key criterion for living a good life is to want to be alive.  I’m not afraid of the work. I’m more afraid of not having good people to work with.  Next time you want to procrastinate, think hard about what you would be doing instead of what you should be doing.  There is always hope.

    "body": "2019/03/17 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Today I want to tell everybody about the best ramen in Pasadena, ube dessertsat Cafe 86, and A Ri Rang Tofu House. (I end up talking about more places,but you’ll have to read on to know which ones. ) Two days ago, I visited Again Cafe x Chibiscus Ramenfor the 3rd time in the past month. I keep coming back to this placebecause their “hand-craft, low-fat, high-protein, hearty, 20-hour bone marrow&amp; vegetable broth” is just that bloodyamazing. I first stumbled upon this place two years ago, when I was still ina “ramen is the best food let’s eat it every day” phase. That’s why there’sso many ramen places on myThings in LA to Try Map. I didn’t think very highly of this place on my first trip. I ordered what Iconsidered, at the time, to be the pinnacle of ramen varieties: hakata styletonkotsu ramen. My friend ordered the same, with some additional veggies andan egg. Why is it important to highlight the egg? Well, at that time, themenu was not very well organized. It was not clear that an egg was alreadyincluded in the ramen so my friend ended up with two whole hard-boiled eggsin her soup. Needless to say, she left with a strange impression of the place. The ramen that day was average. It couldn’t beat Ramen Tatsunoya just a bitnorth. If I thought so highly of Tatsunoya, why did I go back to Chibiscus? I wentback because the line at Tatsunoya was too long. My friends and I circledaround in Old Pas for a bit before finally resigning ourselves to go toChibiscus. I was pleasantly surprised by the new menu. They added a bunchmore ramen varieties, upgraded the documentation, came up with some newrice dishes and small plates, and got some desserts and drinks on the list. I ordered tonkotsu and we got some spam musubi for the table. The ramen wasdelightful. It was nice and hot, the noodles al dente, the chashu tender andflavorful, and the toppings nicely portioned. The spam musubi was a bitsmall and the seaweed a bit tough but the flavor was definitely on point. We ended the evening with chibi brick toast. The chibi brick toast, whichcomes with chocolate sauce, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream,assorted fruits, and butter, was the best brick toast I’ve ever had. Thetoast was crisp on top but exceedingly fluffy inside. It was not too sweet andjust a bit salty from the butter on the toast. The fruits were fresh and theportion was just perfect for the three of us with stomachs full of ramen. That experience at Chibiscus was lovely. I didn’t leave feeling like mystomach had too much acid in it (like I normally do after eating Tatsunoya)and I was so so delighted with the brick toast. I went back maybe a week later, with another friend. The experience was justas good, though we only got dessert this time. The third visit this month was two days ago, on Friday the 15th. The friendI was going with was very hungry. She ordered tonkotsu and I decided tobreak my routine and go for the spicy miso. She melted the moment she gotsome of the broth on her tongue. She devoured her bowl and almost asked formore noodles. She said that she normally can’t finish her food. This was asure sign that this place would be going on her list of places to revisit. The spicy miso didn’t taste too much different from the tonkotsu. The brothis nice and creamy and just a tad more spicy than I expected. It’s a very oilyspice, one that attacks your throat but that can be quickly cooled with a swigof cool water. The onsen egg was expertly cooked to the right consistency. My only suggestion would be to marinate the eggs in soy sauce or somethingsimilar. We ended the evening with an order of takoyaki, perhaps my leastfavorite Japanese food. Chibiscus’ takoyaki comes out piping hot, so besure to bite carefully and blow generously before shoving the smooth, delicatebatter into your mouth. The tako is sparse, but I suppose that’s how things aredone around here. After this third adventure to Chibiscus, we went toCafe 86, which is just up the alley behind 85 C. Cafe 86 is a shop that specializes in ube, a purple yam popular inFilipino cuisine. We got there on a day where the truffles are the special. Friday and Saturday are the days to snag those puppies. She ordered three,ate one immediately, and saved the other two for breakfast. I ordered fourtruffles, one cupcake, and one bundt cake. The truffles are definitelythe thing to go for. These truffles aren’t made of chocolate, so hold yourtongues back if you were thinking of slathering all over some tannins. Thesetruffles are cake truffles, which means they’re made of a rich, fatteningmixture of cake crumbs, frosting, candy melts, and of course the secretingredient ube. Think cake pops but larger, if you’ve had those. The cake popsare $2. 25 a piece, but closer to $2. 5 if you include the famous Americansales tax that insidiously gets added to your bill in every state exceptOregon. These truffles are so creamy, so decadent, so fattening, but not sosweet, you really would do well to serve them at your next afternoon tea. It’s hard for me to describe just how amazing these things are; you’ll haveto come to Old Pas and get one for yourself. The other desserts were ok. Thecupcake wasn’t much to speak of. The bundt cake has lots of chunks of ubein it, if you want to taste more of that. It tastes kind of like taro,especially taro pastes you’ll find in Chinese bakeries. But forget those. Go on Fri or Sat, pick up some truffles, and thank me later. What’s next? A Ri Rang Tofu House. I went here today with a bunch ofclassmates from Ruddock House. It’s a pretty plain Korean restaurant thatserves everything from tofu soups to bibimbap to bulgolgi on steaming castiron plates to chap chae, etc. Why did I not link this place? I didn’t thinkit was that good. The combos are not bad price wise, but the flavors arelacking. You get a lot of banchan, with unlimited refills, so definitelychow those down if you can. The rice is mediocre, the bibimbap doesn’t comewith enough meat and you have to pay $2 extra for the hot stone bowl. Thekimchi isn’t spicy enough, the broccoli banchan was undercooked, etc. I’d giveit a 3 stars. It’s not nearly as good as theTofu House on Convoy, inSan Diego. Anything else? Sure, I can talk about Leberry Bakery, which is a newvegan donut and happy hour with desserts shop in Old Pas. I ordered twodonuts from them last time, and both were average. Not sure if I’ll go back,honestly, which is why I didn’t link. Your mileage may vary. Appendix:While I was writing this, I figured I’d circle back and write about a coupleof other places in Old Pas I figure people should know about.  Soh Grill House     This is a kbbq place up next to Wheat Shop (see below). The biggest impression I had about this place was that the tables were to wide that my party had difficult hearing people from across the table. They had good service that day because the main server was showing a trainee how to serve customers. We got a lot of attention on our meats that day. The food was average tasting and probably somewhat expensive (I wasn’t paying that day). They do have some pretty unique sorbet desserts.  They cut open lemons and peaches and fill them with lemon or peach sorbet, respectively. It’s a cool concept and the flavor isn’t bad. Overall, a 3. 5 star restaurant.     Bone Kettle     This is an uber hyped “we cook soup with bones” (like how the **** else do you cook soup) Indonesian place in Old Pas. The ambience is nice and fancy but the food is underflavored. I ordered a quite expensive oxtail + noodles bowl (you can get it cheaper at [Borneo]). (https://www. yelp. com/biz/borneo-kalimantan-cuisine-alhambra-2) The broth tasted like nothing special. I was hoping for more flavor, for more punch. The oxtail was pretty tender, but I still think Borneo makes their even more “fall off the bone”. The uber expensive fancy organic carrots and onions and other vegetables were a nice touch and fit the scene, but I was underwhelmed by the rest so they didn’t make me feel any better at the time. The noodles were thin and tasty.  Overall, I think I’m salty about this place not being salty or exotically flavored enough, like Borneo is. I won’t say it should be off your list, but unless it’s your special “spend money on food” day or you’re really craving soup or you just want somewhere fancy to go, I would recommend you look to Borneo for more crazy Indonesian flavors and comfort food. Also, if you do plan to go, try to make a reservation beforehand. It’ll save you something like a 30 min wait.     Wheat Shop     Yeah, the website is ugly, but the cream puffs are worth every dollar.  The cream puffs come in chocolate, vanilla, matcha, and hazelnut. They don’t last very long, so the sooner you go from paying to shoving them (delicately) in your mouth, the more you will agree with my assessment of just how amazing they are. I haven’t tried the other food they sell, but the cream puffs are absoutely the kind of oversized dessert you want to get for yourself when you’re feeling down and want that food comfort.  So, actually, why are the cream puffs that good? The outside is delightfully crispy and the inside has very fresh tasting cream. It’s not too sweet, and the outer layer will practically dissolve on your tongue as you bite into it.    Just one last shout out to Caltech’s pasty chef(s), who produce some amazingthings like guava + cheese pastries, apple tarts, almond croissants, chocolatetarts, etc. every day. Stop by Hameetman for one of our flaky, buttery, badfor your health but irresistibly delicious taste experiences. "

    "body": "2019/03/05 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Yesterday evening, I went back to a new favorite of mine in Pasadena: Miss Cheese Cafe. This is a new place that opened just over a month ago, at the corner of Cordova and Arroyo Parkway. A little history on this location. It’s been through 3 business changes since I matriculated at Caltech in 2015. First, it was Flour and Tea. Yes, the same Flour and Tea that is on Lake and serves Poke. Flour and Tea used to have both locations, but the Cordova location only had drinks and desserts like cookies and bread. Then it was Oh My Pan bakery. I remember going there once with a group of friends for the brick toast in the morning and leaving because they wouldn’t have it readyuntil 11am. We ended up going to Amara for brunch, which was a fantastically delicious and filling choice. And now the location is Miss Cheese. A quick look at Google Street View shows that Flour and Tea actually had the location for almost 4 years before it got handed over to Oh My Pan in 2016. Oh My Pan had the location for about 3 years before it became Miss Cheese in Jan 2019. I don’t have a good sense for how stable food businesses should be, but this turnover feels fast. One of the major issues with the location is its poor visibility. It’s absolutely impossible to see until you’re right next to it when you’re heading north on Arroyo Parkway. The intersection of Cordova and Arroyo is a dead end into Public Storage. The sign is hard to see even if you’re going West along Cordova or south along Arroyo. It’s far away from all the other foods and shops on Colorado and Green Street. Overall, this corner is a very tucked away, nondescript couple of square meters that you’re likely to be intrigued by then forget immediately as you drive off to your more exciting location. I don’t work for Miss Cheese, but I’d advise you to pay some more attention to this place, because their boba has the perfect consistency and their desserts are worth every dollar. The drinks are hit and miss, but I figure they’ll eventually get the flavor down pat. The desserts. Miss Cheese makes a light, fluffy, delicious version of souffle that will melt on your tongue and delight your taste buds with every bite. The souffle comes in strawberry, plain, boba, and matcha. Each souffle is topped with a light, frothy, creamy sauce of unknown but irresistible ingredients. This is what I got the first time I went and is what I’ve been taking all my friends here for. The other dessert they have is the mille crepe cake that Lady M has made famous. The crepe cake comes in Oreo, matcha, and plain. I tried the Oreo last night. The Oreo creme in between the crepe layers was a bit light for my tastes, but the texture of the cake was nice and soft. Lady M’s crepe cakes have thinner layers, but the thickness does not at all detract from the flavor. Both the souffles and crepe cakes are made fresh in house. That is why you may end up waiting 20 - 30 min for your perfect, buoyant, glistening souffles to come out of the kitchen. The crepe cakes are made in the morning then stored in the fridge, so the wait time will be maybe 5 min at most. Miss Cheese has other desserts, like Japanese cheesecake and Taiyaki, which I’ll have to try the next time I go. I almost forgot to mention that all their foods are exceedingly Instagram worthy. Now the drinks. The one drink I’ve been most satisfied with from Miss Cheese is the sesame drink. I love black sesame. Give me all the black sesame 湯圓，麻吉，drinks, etc. in the world. Miss Cheese’s black sesame drink comes with black sesame cheese foam, which is to die for. It has a wonderfully rich sesame flavor and isn’t overwhelmingly oily, like 嘆茶’s cheese foam. The liquid is ok, but not quite full-bodied enough for me. Maybe it’s because I ordered half sweet. I’ve also tried their tiramisu ceylon tea. Ceylon tea is the base for thai tea. The tiramisu foam has too much cocoa flavor for me. It didn’t really taste like tiramisu. The drink was also too bitter for my taste. I ended up tossing it after drinking 30% of the liquid. If you’re looking for a cute dessert place to chill at in Pasadena, Miss Cheese is not a bad option. They have wonderful souffles and crepe cakes to keep your taste buds busy. Don’t forget to add their perfectly cooked boba to your drinks! Just remember that it’s in a hard to spot location, so don’t lose patience if you don’t quite see it as you’re approaching the corner of Cordova and Arroyo Parkway. As usual, contact information is at the top of the pgae. "

    "body": "2019/03/05 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com This is a post about avoiding FOMO, or fear of missing out. I was rereading this excellent article from Morgan Housel of Collaborative Fund recently. This time, one of the things that popped out to me was point 14: “A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are. ” For context, his post is about mental flaws and biases he’s seen when people deal with money. He illustrates the danger of point 14 by talking about short-term traders. Short-term traders are likely playing a different game from most amateur investors, who are really best off doing the invest-once, wait 20 years, witness the magic of compounding and the strength of the global economy (or American economy) kind of thing. The danger in playing the stock marketoff the short-term traders’ cues is that you screw up your strategy. You start thinking that temporary price bubbles are the only reasonable price you can get your favorite stock at. You start freaking out when the market jitters by 1% each day. You start getting up at 4am to watch Bloomberg, check CNN, put a couple of stop-limit orders, drink a couple of cups of coffee, and chat up your broker, on those 8 separate 20k screens you just bought. You start forgetting what your priorities and your focus should be. Don’t do that. Don’t get distracted. Don’t start getting FOMO. You play the game you think you should be playing. Until there is sufficient evidence to suggest that you’re an absolute fool and that your strategy won’t achieve your goals, it’s best to sit back and watch the compounding fairies do their work. There are a million ways to skin the cat. Anybody who is skinning it a different way from you is merely another person to observe, to learn from, and to discard if irrelevant to your life goals and trajectory. Don’t get distracted by everybody else in the world. Live by your values, focus on your priorities, build the life you think is worth living. "

    "body": "2019/03/04 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I went out this weekend to three exciting restaurants. You can take a lookat the restaurants still on my checklist by going to “Useful Links” &gt; “Places in LA to Try”. The first was Thien An Bo 7 Mon,In Rosemead. This is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant with pho andbun cha (my personal favorite). Ifyou want that kind of Vietnamese, I’d suggest you go a bit northwest toGolden Deli. Back to Thien An. Thien An Bo 7 Mon is a higher end Vietnamese restaurant,specializing in the Bo 7 Monthat is a Saigon classic. Bo 7 Mon is $23 as of last Saturday. Thien An alsoserves whole catfish and vinegar hot pots and other “cook yourself” meats likeboar and shrimp. The cook yourself portion is like kbbq but Vietnamese style. You get a small, oiled up cast iron plate on which to fry some marinatedboar or shrimp or beef. It’s certainly a sight to see and a great place toinvite family and friends for a fancier dinner. I chickened out of paying for a $20+ entree and instead ordered the friedrice. The fried rice was nothing special (as expected), but it filled me upfor the night. The friend I went with ordered the cook yourself on a castiron griddle wild boar, which came with all the classic toppings you needfor making rice paper spring rolls. I chickened out of trying his food, butit looked pretty tasty. The table next to us ordered something like $140 worthof cook your own meats. They had 5 people, and the portion seemed just rightfor the two voracious men and three women of medium appetite. I probably won’t be going back to Thien An Bo 7 Mon unless I have a party toplan, but it certainly deserves a place on my list for its flair. Yesterday was a whole different kind of food adventure. I took two classmatesout to Chinatown to try out Eddie Huang’s BaoHaus and Mr. Churro. I’vebeen wanting to go to NYC to get BaoHaus since, like, years ago. I’m a diehard for Taiwanese street food, and Eddie’s stuff looked legit. Those crushedpeanuts and 酸菜? Mmm. So we booked an Uber and headed on down into ChinaTown. BaoHaus is in this alley with Ten Ren’s tea and a whole bunch of otherstuff. They don’t have a raging line, but the shop next door, Howlin’ Ray’s,has got a line wrapping around the downstairs plaza. That place is on my listfor next time. Anyway, BaoHaus is a nondescript little counter shop that plays some lit hiphop and has a vintage letter board. The walls have graffiti and polaroidcovered wooden boards. The feeling is exactly as I expected. I ordered theChairman Mao, which is the classic pork belly bao, and the Birdhaus, whichlays a popcorn chicken type piece of fried bird between the bread. The meatswere very tender and fresh. The pork belly was very tender and nicelyseasoned. The Birdhaus has a beautiful crunch and got the flavor just right. I just wish the Birdhaus was a tad more spicy. The other complaints are that there weren’t enough condimentson my baos. Not enough peanuts, not enough 酸菜. I guess I’ll have to ask forextra of those if I go back. After we chowed down some baos, we went walking through Chinatown to Mr. Churro, an establishment known for its filled churros. I got two filledchurros, guava and lechere, for $3. 75 each. Plain churros are $2. 75 each. Themoney is well spent. One, the churros are huge and fresh, two the flavors aregorgeous. A friend got a raspado, which was huge and more than enough fortwo people with average appetites. I have a personal love for condensed milk,so lechere was by far the superior choice on filling. The filling may be toorich for some people, so just go for the plain if you’re afraid it will betoo sweet. Mr. Churro also serves ice cream and juices and classic Mexicanfoods. I guess I’ll have to go back for a full meal and dessert next time. If you’re like us an live in Pasadena, pay attention to the Mini Storagesign next time you come back along the 110. They sometimes have quirky messageson the board. It once said: “ Smile while you still have teeth. “ Yesterday’smessage had something to do with apples. The other side said something aboutdrive through coffee. Google Street View will reveal some of the messages. All three places I mentioned today are now on my Places in the World I Like map. Need a review on another place on that list? I’d be happy to supply it. As usual, contact info is at the top of the page. "

    "body": "2019/02/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com There are some days when digital communication pisses me off to planes higherthan it should be able to excite me to. These are the days when people aretrying to schedule a time to meet in person but people are too busymulti-tasking or trying to ghost each other that the time never gets set andthe meeting doesn’t happen. I think these days are worse than those whenpeople show up late or are no-shows and any attempt to contact them prior to oraround the preset meeting time meet with delivered but unreads. I think thesedays are also worse than those when you get ghosted before a plan gets set. I think these are worse than the days when you don’t talk to a single personin person. Anyway, my point in bringing up the first, worst kind of digital communicationmishap is that I think there’s so much lost value in just getting up off your() and talking to that person. This is especially true when you live in acollege dorm (like I do~) or if you’re in an office with that person. Evenif the conversation only takes 5 minutes, the experience is almost alwaysbetter in person. There’s something about how free form meeting in persontends to be, how you could say almost anything when you’re sharing thesame airspace, how easily that 5 minutes could turn into an hour that makesthe experience more magical. Besides, I think getting disturbed by theoccasional knock on the door is much more friendly than being disturbed bythe incessant buzzing of my phone in my pocket or the infinite littlepings of Slack or FB notifications. All it takes is a five minute walk to find the people you care about. Allit takes is a bit of disregard for notions of efficiency and productivity and“but I could just text them” laziness that are all too common in the modernlexicon. Spend time, in person, with the people who matter to you. Those arethe interactions that really count. "

If that is what is going to happen, so be it. Come at me with allyou’ve got. This blog exists because it’s a way I pursue happiness, buthappiness doesn’t achieve full flavor except when paired with its opposite. So far, I’m not ashamed of my previous posts. This probably supports theidea that people don’t change much over time. I am still largely in alignmentwith my previous ideas and worldview, and I’m still happy with the way Iattempted to share those beliefs with my readers. If this feeling ofconsistency has truly been sustained over the past 1. 5 years, does that implythat I have plateaued? There’s no denying that my brain plasticity has vastlydecreased over the past 20 years of my life. There’s no denying that it willcontinue to decrease. But I also don’t think there’s any denying that mypersonality was probably visible by the time I entered elementary school. Ifit wasn’t visible then, it would have been strongly visible by the time Ileft elementary school. There have been some surprises among my elementaryschool classmates, most of whom ended up going to the same middle and highschool as me, but nothing that was vastly out of line with our understanding ofwho they were when they were 6 year olds. The possibility that I have plateaued is frightening and frustrating, more sobecause I believe in fighting for constant, never-ending improvement. It’sfatalistic to say that my current level is a close enough approximationto my level 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the line. But is it foolish tothink that I still have the potential to become as amazing as an Elon Muskbefore I die? Is the fact that I can state that desire just a fault ofbeing young? Or is the inclination to crush those dreams a fault ofsomething else, like an optimization for productivity and love for deadlinesover optimization for happiness.

    "body": "2019/02/19 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I recently had a rather brazen, obnoxious thought about why I should sharemy thoughts, especially those thoughts that emerge suddenly and seem justabsolutely brilliant in the moment. The thought went something like this:  I’m not done talking. I want you to know the full extent of my intellectualcapacity, of my smartness, so I’m going to tell you all the profound thingsthat are currently on my mind, even if they end up being not profound ordownright stupid a few minutes later. I think that reflects on how I run this blog. Every so often, I’ll have whatseems to be a profound thought about the universe. Sometimes, that profoundthought will trigger enough subsequent thinking and substance that I willconsider writing a post about it. Normally, if the post doesn’t get finishedon that first wave of inspiration, it will sit as an unfinished draft, waitingfor me to figure out what exactly was so worthwhile about those loose threadsof thought. As a result, most of what I write on this blog probably ends upbeing mediocre, with a very small half-life. That result is ok, in the sensethat this blog can just be a bucket of my thoughts. It will be a publicrepository of my mental development over the years. Likely some people willtake offense with the public nature of the blog. Why risk exposing dangerous,potentially black-mail or lawsuit worthy thoughts onto the internet, whereanybody and anything can take advantage of it? The obscurity that I currentlyenjoy may last a long time. It may end very soon. I do this is because I like it. I like the idea of having other peoplecombing through my thinking. I like the idea that I have good thoughts,thoughts that galvanize, upset, stimulate other people. I like the idea ofbeing on the internet, of being discoverable, of being latent. I like writing. There it is. When I don’t write, I have nothing profound to say. When I dowrite, I’ve got an itch to scratch, an itch that says I have somethingprofound to say, something that the world hasn’t considered in a good enoughway before, something that reinforces my belief in my intellect.

The file system abstracts your file cabinet. The mouse button sometimes looks like a hand because it is supposed to represent your physical hand grabbing an object.   The internet is just one large computer. It’s a big computer made up of lots of smaller computers. Google and other search engines search through the Internet file system. Web addresses are like file paths on your local computer; they represent the sequence of nested file folders you have to open to get to your desired document. Your web browser is like your secretary, keeping track of where you’ve been and how you got there. The web browser also formats files as nicely as it can. Formatting can be hard, because sometimes files are in strange formats. When the Internet is slow, think about how some people are slow to deliver on promises or respond to your messages. This just means that subcomputer is underpowered. More people want to talk to it than it can talk to at one time.   The internet is like an amusement park. You have to pay an entrance fee to an Internet Service Provider to get in. Once you’re in, they will watch and record everything that you do. This amusement park never closes and pretty much has no rules, so you have to be careful to protect yourself. The EFF is an organization that wants to help protect you. You can download some of their protective tools from the link I attached.   There is more to the internet and computers, like online advertising and hardware, but those leak beyond the physical abstractions. Feel free to use the internet to learn more about those things.

    "title": "On Making Decisions",
    "body": "2019/02/01 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com There are two important statements about making decisions that I would liketo remind or inform everybody of:  Marginal improvements in quality of decision quickly falls off with time.  It is normally very easy to resolve uncertainty. The conclusion I’ve drawn from the first point is that we should all bemaking decisions faster. The conclusion I’ve drawn from the second point is that we should all bemaking decisions faster. Think about it, why do people resist making decisions? Because there is someuncertainty tied to the decision that they don’t know how to, don’t feellike, are afraid to, etc. resolve. “What if they don’t approve?” “We haven’tasked Abby yet. ” “What if lightning burns down the house?” etc. etc. Most of the time the uncertainties people deal with are irrelevant to thequestion at hand or are very easily resolved. For example, consider the caseof a group of people trying to arrange a surprise birthday dinner for afriend. They’re stuck on what kind of restaurant to reserve a table at. Surelyit’s easy to ask the birthday person about their food preferences in casualconversation. Or just choose a restaurant that doesn’t require reservations soyou can easily go somewhere else if the birthday person has objections. Choosea restaurant in a busy city center so you have a lot of options nearby ifthings end up going poorly. Make the decision quickly and just move on. In theend, no one will care that much what kind of food you choose. The point oforganizing the party is to get everybody together, to experience that minglingof happiness and gratitude and warmth that comes from people sharing in joy. Or consider the case of a small product team debating whether or not tobegin selling Amazon. They worry about the costs, the effort required toget set up, how many people they will need to hire to manage the campaigns,etc. etc. One, you haven’t even done any practical work to get first-handexperience of the Amazon ecosystem. Two, it’s not going to be that hard toget set up and list one product. Three, someone can work on this as a smallside project. You don’t need to worry about campaign success until it happens. Delay as many of these projections as long as possible. Just get started,because you’re not going to resolve any uncertainty by speculating abouthow about hard it is. Besides, what’s the cost of this? Someone wastes acouple hours a week trying to get it going and nothing happens? You spent acouple hundred dollars shipping a couple products, doing advertising? Now youknow what it’s like. You know the limitations, the advantages, when you willbe better suited to pursue the Amazon strategy. Or maybe you now know whatquestions to ask an “Amazon expert”. There are some things you can know untilyou know more. So work on resolving the uncertainty. Get moving. Makedecisions faster. Or consider the case of a couple deciding where to buy a new house. Theywant it to be in a quiet neighborhood, near a good school, under a certainprice, etc. etc. They currently don’t know which of five neighborhoods isbetter. They’ve talked to current residents of each neighborhood, done onlineresearch, talked to realtors, family, etc. , but they still don’t think theycan make a good decision. Why not just live in each neighboorhood for a week?Make a friend, stay in their guest bedroom for a week? Or commute and shop andperform daily rituals near that neighboorhood? Rent for a short time nearthe neighboorhood? Book a hotel nearby? AirBnb? In this case, the consequencesof making the wrong choice are more costly, so it makes sense to be more sureabout the decision. But at this point, they have already done all the researchthey can do. It’s time for them to make a move and get on with their lives. Worst case, they can sign a rental contract in one of the neighborhoods. Thisway, if they really end up hating that neighboorhood, they are less anchoredthan they would have been if they had bought a house. I think we are all familiar with the feeling of “I don’t know what else to dobut I still don’t know how to make this decision”. We know we’ve exhausted allthe low-hanging decision-making resources and yet we still want to keeplooking??? It’s just going to be harder and harder to find useful nuggetsthat can push us closer to a decision. So stop wasting time, mental energy,etc. and make the decision! If you have uncertainties that you caneasily resolve, then resolve them! Ask whoever you need to ask. Declaresomething to be unimportant. Make a decision and move forward with your lifeto doing the important work of making your decision a reality. And if youfail? That’s great, because we learn a lot through failure. In fact, thetighter you can get the decide-act-feedback loop, the more you will learn. That’s another incentive for you to make decisions faster. Comments, questions, stories, etc can go to my email.

    "body": "2019/01/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Let’s talk a bit about flight planning today. I just completed a trainingtrip with my instructor and two friends (see photo) out to Chino airporttoday. This flight was originally meant for Tuesday, 1/22, but there werestill very strong winds from the windstorm on Monday (gusting 9 - 26kts), sowe postponed to today. El Monte (KEMT), which is nicknamed Elmoo on TACs (terminal area charts), isour home airport. Chino is about 21nm south east of El Monte. To get to Chino, we will pass under Ontario’s airspace. This means ouraltitude will be limited to 2500’.  Notice there is another airport that is in between KEMT and KCNO: KPOC, orBrackett. Their airspace extends down to the northern intersection of the60 and 57 freeways. We will avoid them by aiming towards the southernintersection of the 60 and 57 freeways. Be careful not to mistake the compassrose for their airspace. Approximate final trajectory: Assuming runway 19 (preferred runway) is in use from KEMT, we’ll ask for aleft crosswind, or southeast departure. It just happened that day that thewinds were favoring runway 1, so we asked for a right crosswind departure. Wemade our right turn fairly early, at about 300ft AGL, or 500’ MSL. We aimedfor the hotel on a hill, which is the blue region just north of thePomona Freeway flag on the TAC. From there, we aimed for the southern 60/57intersection, then straight on towards Chino. We talked with Chino tower about 10 miles out, or when we crossed the 57. Winds were variable that day, so there was a bit of turbulence heading overPuente Hills. Normally, runway 26 is favored at Chino, but that day, windswere mostly favoring runway 8. We landed 8L, and got off at Kilo. We did two touch and go’s (if my memory is behaving properly) on 8L before weasked for a runway change to RW 3. Again, winds were variable. There was ahelicopter practicing on the north east side of RW 3, so ATC took some time tomove him. We were almost on base when ATC asked us to delay and head furthersouth because a jet was coming in. We obeyed by climbing a bit to the souththen gently circling over the cow fields. The pilot of this jet was really something. He initially said something to ATCthat was relevant for Ontario. ATC corrected him and then gave himinstructions on heading to Ontario. The pilot didn’t repeat instructions backcorrectly, so ATC continued to work with him on making sure he got thefrequencies right and was clear on his intentions. Once that was done, we gotcleared to approach RW 3…until that jet decided it was actually going toland at Chino. So we proceeded to circle again. We watched the jet land,then made our final touch and go on RW 3 before heading back to El Monte. Here’s a couple random notes regarding Chino airport. You can really smellthe cows. The airport is surrounded by a bunch of lush, green fields, some ofwhich have cows. Mind you, we’re flying something like 1400 - 2200’, and thesmell of manure is still hitting hard. There is also a temple just west ofChino airport. I didn’t get any photos, but it’s really a sight from the air. They have a big pink building with a gray star on top. There are also twoprisons near the airport. Those are certainly useable as markers for finalapproach. We executed left crosswind after takeoff from RW 3. We pretty much retracedour path over Diamond Bar, then angling up to the 10, then following the10 back for right traffic onto RW 1. We contacted KEMT about 10 nm out. Overall, this was a pretty uneventful training trip. There was a bit ofturbulence, but nothing big enough to bother me or my passengers. I brought two friends with me that day, so weight and balance calculationswere definitely a necessary procedure before the flight. Here’s a picture ofthe numbers I used: We filled up pretty much to max gross, so 30 gals of fuel. 760’s fuelconsumption is about 7. 4gph, so at 42nm straight line round trip distance,and 110kts cruising speed, we had plenty of margin for all the other thingswe wanted to do that day. Here’s a free online service where you can track flights. The flight I justdescribed was from 1/24, 10:57am - 12:07pm. "

    "title": "Conceptual Library Setup",
    "body": "2019/01/22 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I just had a strange ideafor a personal library setup. This is a physical personal library, mind you,because the whole point is to have the visitor or owner be able to wanderthrough and glean something meaningful from the physical arrangement. Back to the main point. The shelves should be mobile. The books should beplaced in chronological order of when they were last read. I originallythought they should be placed where they were bought, because that wouldallow one to immediately see what kind of knowledge acquisition phase thereader was going through at that time. This would make trends in mentaldevelopment of the reader more obvious. But dates can be inscribed onthe inside of the book, so it’s probably more useful to organize the booksbased on chronological order of reading. Each read, just like each checkout,gets a stamp on a card inside the book, or in a database, so it’s easy to knowhow often the book gets read by that person. It reflects, again, on thereader’s mental development and state. This book arrangement means that bookswill accumulate in some direction, emptying shelves at the end. To maintainspatial order, you should move the shelves back, which is why I suggestedmobile shelves. Now that I’m thinking about it more, it’s probably best to integratesome automated book retrieval system. I love the idea of having a physicalspace to walk around and read in, so you’ll still need to allocate space. What changes now, is that instead of having physical book shelves to browse,you’ll have digital panels that will show you the real-time, always-up-to-datearrangement of books in the collection. Touch screens can be incorporatedso people can preview the books, see book reviews, see reading history,etc. People who want to checkout a book can just tap “checkout” and have arobot arm deliver it to a pickup section. There is still a space limitationhere, in the sense that if you want to maintain the same magnification of thebooks on your digital screen, you will have to continually buy new screens andallocate more space. You could either shrink the digital shelf magnificationor move to a infinite scroll type shelf. At this point, unless someone has a real desire for what I’ve described, thisidea will remain the product of Tuesday morning idle speculation. Questions, comments, etc. can go to my inbox (above). "

    "title": "Passive Income Strategies",
    "body": "2019/01/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com One of my goals for this year, perhaps before I graduate in June, is to setup a passive income strategy generating $500/month. I think $500/month isgoing to be a fairly tough goal, based on what little I’ve seen of otherpeople’s reported passive strategies. But $500/month ($6k/year) is largeenough that it actually feels productive. Below are a couple of the ideas I’ve had:  Selling high margin products through Amazon FBA     I have a friend who makes &gt; $100k selling on Amazon andhis own website. It takes him, as hesays, maybe an hour a week packing boxes in his underwear.    The struggle here is finding the right product(s). Given my previous,lackadaisical attitude towards market research of any form, I’m not surehow well I’ll succeed in doing the FBA research.     Franchising     This seems to require to require far too much initial, in-person, effortto be really attractive for me. I guess, once it’s set up right, withyou just taking a cut of profits while other people run the show, it canwork out nicely.     Ads     Sure, ads are easy to add to anything. I could add ads to this websitewith fairly low effort. But do I really want to have a bunch of clickbaitor ugly ads on this beautiful, hand-crafted website? No, I don’t want towaste your people’s time with something so crude.    One other way to get ad revenue is through YouTube. I once debated theidea of starting a channel where every day, a new one-minute videoof me counting 10 numbers would be posted. For example, Mondays would beEnglish, Tuesdays Russian, Wednesdays Chinese, Thursdays review English,etc. Each week, we would advance another 10 numbers, so by the end ofthe year, we’d have counted to 500. It’s not much effort on my part,but I also don’t think it’s particularly effective as a YouTube incomeproducer.     Affiliate Marketing     I played the role of salesman for Kanberra Gel two summers ago. I wouldgive samples to Uber drivers, in the hopes that they would prefer ourall-natural, tea tree oil air cleaner over the tree-shaped, soap-smellingair fresheners they normally used. It was kind of fun, kind ofnerve-wracking, mostly exhausting. I have since tried to avoid any kindof salesman or campus ambassador positions, because I don’t think thoseroles really fulfill me.     Selling designs (t-shirts, stickers, etc)     This could turn out nice, but I think the expected value here is very low. It’s likely a volume game, and I’ve already said I don’t really want towork on marketing or selling my stuff, so that pretty much means I’mgoing to suffer low-volume, low-revenue if I pursue this idea.     Investing (stock market, real estate)     This is probably the most obvious of the passive income strategies. I used to be very invested (haha) in investing but eventually acknowledgedthe truth that I really didn’t enjoy thinking about the stock market andgave up. Maybe one day, I’ll take it up again.    I think real estate investing has a limitation of requiring relativelyhigh starting capital base, so I may not be able to really pursue it forsome time. More on real estate and owning land later.     Rental property     The most classic rental property is to rent out house space, throughAirBnB or Craigslist. But I think people should consider renting outevery other piece of property they own. For example, car sharing throughTuro. Other forms of rental could be renting out kitchen equipment, likea KitchenAid standmixer, or blender for some hourly rate. What aboutrenting out your bike, scooter, backyard, front yard, tool bag, etc?As a college student who doesn’t have much space or frequent need forsome of the above things, I find the idea of rental household equipmentpretty valuable.     Royalties     Here is where I begin thinking about monetizing my ideas more thanphysical manifestations of my ideas. The most obvious royalty-basedproducts are music and books. Maybe one day I’ll have enough wisdom toput in a book and share with others.    Stratechery isn’t royalty-based, but it’sa neat way to monetize all those smarts Ben Thompson’s got in his head.     Vending Machine     I think this is largely a real estate game. You have to find the placeswith good traffic with hungry, anxious, bored, etc people with no otheroptions. You have to make sure the rate of vandalism is low enough thatyou aren’t going to lose sleep over broken front panels or stolen goods. But, if you have the capital and connections to acquire a machine andget it somewhere good, this probably isn’t a bad passive strategy. You could probably pay someone to collect the money for you at somepoint.     (Subscription) Software     I’m thinking stuff like Freedom, orTimeOut. I feel like this strategy is more frontloaded than some of theabove, but it has a faster decaying tail than something like, investing,or real estate, or rentals, maybe…I don’t have data to back this up,only anecdotal considerations.    Passive income doesn’t have to be 5 min each day for 100K ayear. As long as the hourly rate is above some minimum, like $500/hr, andthe yearly commitment is below some maximum, like 200 hours (10% of40hr/week yearly work rate), your strategy could be considered passive income. With that definition, perhaps there are even some side jobs that would qualifyas passive income. For example, giving talks, or occasional consulting jobs. My goal with this passive income endeavor is to FIRE (Financial IndependenceRetire Early). Sure, with a software developer’s income, it’s “easy” to achieveFIRE (where’s the sarcasm text modifier), but the easiness is still modulatedby the size of the capital base you need to accumulate. I’ll need to do thecalculations to figure out how much money I actually need to be happy goingforward. I mentioned above that I would talk about real estate later. Now’s that later. I also mentioned in my previous post that I would talk about things peoplefind repeated value in. This idea is currently very rough, but I was thinkingabout how people can repeatedly enjoy using a piece of land yesterday. Forexample, think about the repeated value of a park, a mall, a basketball court,a soccer field, your backyard, a pool, etc. I guess I want whatever I createas a passive income generator to be reusable. If it’s subscription software,I want people to continuously use it. I want people to continuously seek outmy rental property. I want people to continuously look for my t-shirtdesigns. I want people to frequent my franchise. If it’s investing, …, Isuppose I want whatever I invest in to have that repeated value quality to it. Maybe the above paragraph is a bit stupid, because everything, from shoes, toyour desk, to your clothes, has repeated value. Things get consumed and needto be replaced all the time. That’s just part of the cycle of life. Wefight hard, work hard, do things every day because flow and happiness areelusive. We need to go out and search, to seek our flow each and every day. Maybe that’s what I was thinking about yesterday, over that mediocre bowlof ramen. "

    "title": "Make People Happy",
    "body": "2019/01/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I believe the fundamental human pursuit is happiness.  Unalienable rights: Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. The best theory of happiness I have see so far is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’sFlow. Flow is achievedwhen challenge matches skill. Flow is the happiness we are looking for. The prevailing business theory is that every business, every product,everything must have a job. Everything must exist to fulfill some need ordesire. Your computer helps you get work done, helps you restock householdsupplies, keeps you entertained, etc. Your washing machine helps you cleanyour clothes efficiently. Your friends keep you entertained and help takecare of you. Whatever you create, whatever you do, then, must fulfill someneed or desire. Or so the thinking goes. I think the more fundamental objective is to make people happy by helpingthem achieve flow. Let’s look at a couple of products and brands that people“love”. Let’s also look at the idea of “saving time and money”. That’s anidea that I don’t think is going to change. First, Costco. People LOVE Costco. I love Costco, even though it doesn’tmake sense for me to shop there. I love Costco for pretty much the samereasons everybody else does: unbeatable, convenient deals. Making thedecision to shop at Costco is a low effort, low skill decision. Sure, maybeyou need to do a little budgeting to account for all the extra “deals” youwill be picking up at the store, but the $50 membership fee is easilyrecouped, especially if you buy higher ticket items like vacation and rentalcars through the company. Costco also helps people save time and money. Why is saving time and money so important? It’s not just because Bezos,with his infinite wisdom, pronounced it important. My hunch is that it’sbecause time and money are hard to recoup. To be clear, time is impossible torecoup. Money is definitely recoupable, but the general consensus about workis that it’s a drag, so it’s best to consider money as a difficult to recoverresource. This doesn’t explain everything, though. How does the difficulty,or impossibility, of recouping these items have to do with flow and happiness?Time is impossible to recover, so one can never achieve flow againsttime. Money is difficult to recoup, and decreases in wealth can mean painfullifestyle changes, so the challenge of making money can exceed many people’sskill levels. When things are too hard, people get frustrated. When things are too easy,people get bored. Dealing with the expenditure of time and money is somethingthat tends to get people frustrated. Helping them manage the flow with a moremanageable amount of challenge puts them back into a flow state. Another wayto think about this is perhaps that helping people save time and money meansallowing them to spend those resources on other flow-inducing activities. Saving $1,000 on vacation means they have another $1,000 to use on video gamesor another vacation, or gardening. Saving an hour of time by booking throughCostco means you have another hour to play Call of Duty with or read a bookor watch an episode of Games of Thrones in. Saving time and money is soeffective a strategy because they are such obnoxious resources for us tomanage. Next, Google. The sentiment towards Google has changed with all the issuesaround privacy and censorship in China and AMP, etc, but Google is still aservice that people cannot live without. Why has Google and its relatedproducts, like YouTube, done so well? Google made searching for informationexceedingly low effort. Low challenge, low skill? That’s a flow match. YouTubemade searching for videos and storing videos and sharing videos super smooth. Anybody can set up a vlog, or a personal online video store. But Googlealso saves its users and customers time and money. Google is likely the mostefficient search engine on the internet. DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc, have allimproved their search results, but you’re likely to get where you want thefastest when using Google. Even if that’s not the case, the reputation is sostrong that switching costs will override most attempts to leave Google. Google is also a hugely effective advertiser. You get insane reach with just acouple of dollars spent on your text ad for mesothelioma claims services. Google has made our lives more delightful by making difficult, non-flow taskslike research and advertising and video entertainment so much easier. Third, Amazon. You know Amazon’s logo is hiding a smile, right? Amazon has been delighting customers for over 20 years now. Youcan track the happiness metric by looking at the amount of money that flowsinto their coffers every year. People spend so much money and time on Amazonbecause it’s the ultimate online shopping destination. It super easy tofind what you want, and it’s super easy, with 1-click ordering, to get whatyou want. Over the years, they’ve expanded their offerings into cloudservices, movies, fashion, groceries, music, so now you can get even more ofwhat you want, sometimes before you know you want it (those darnrecommendation algorithms), at amazing prices and low effort. Low challenge,low effort, saving time and money? All the boxes have been checked. Perhaps there’s a bit of a spurious saving time and money kind of thing goingon here. It may be the case that we are saving time and money onindividual transactions at Amazon or Costco or Google but are spendingmore in aggregate. We love going to Costco so much that we end up spending10% more on toilet paper each year. “But it’s so cheap and you get 50 rollsof premium, 40-ply at a time!” We love shopping on Amazon so much that we endup spending 50% more on Christmas gifts through the site each year. “Oh,but where else was I going to get those wooden coasters for Uncle Joe forsuch a great price and free 2-day shipping?” It’s so easy to spend time onGoogle searching for things that we now spend 20% more time doing “research”on Google, browsing the web through Google, that we would have without it. I don’t want to make any false claims about this kind of behavior beingharmful. I just want to bring up the idea that our accounting for the newbehaviors these services encourage may not exactly add up the way we expect. Fourth, dating sites. We’ve talked about time and money as being primeexamples of things that we aren’t usually in flow states when dealing with. But what about that other huge cause of anxiety? Relationships. It’s so easyto meet new people, to have friends, when you’re forced together in a placewith social expectations like school. Once you leave school, your socialand romantic interactions are completely left up to your discretion. It washard enough to get to know people in school. Now you have to find them andget to know them. Dating services like Tinder or eHarmony or Match. com helpresolve this issue with relatively low effort, relatively low skill required. You save time and money! Now you can sit at home and save up your energy andmoney for dates with matches! I’ve pushed this flow as happiness concept hard in this post, but I think theidea stands up to the evidence. Great brands, great companies, great services,etc, certainly do solve people’s needs. But the reason they’ve got such astrong hold on people is because they create happiness through flow. Theyask for little effort and little skill to make life easier, especially torelieve people of great burdens regarding time, money, and emotional energy. Questions, comments, etc, can be sent to my inbox~. In my next post, I want to talk about passive income strategies. One of thepoints I hope to explore is the idea of things that people find repeated valuein. Flow and happiness is definitely tied to my understanding of repeatedvalue, so I also want to develop my understanding of those concepts. See you next time. "

    "body": "2019/01/19 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I’m currently 11. 6 hours into my flight training. I am working towards mysingle engine land private pilot’s license, which allows me to pilotsingle engine prop planes. There are more details than that, of course,but you can read about that yourself. To be honest, I wasn’t convinced that this flying thing was cool until acouple of lessons ago. At some point, something clicked with me about theact of maneuvering a vehicle into a stable floating position in the air. Maybe it was the point when things sort of started to make sense. Maybe itwas when I began to understand how to make the plane do certain things, likehold a certain altitude, or climb faster, climb slower, hold a certain speed. Regardless of when that transition happened, I’m now happily convinced thatputting time into flying is worth it. Here’s a photo of my logbook, so you can see what I’ve done so far and forhow long I’ve done them.  I’ll discuss a few of the things I’ve begun to understand since beginningflight training:    Weather   This is an example of a current aviation weather report:   KCNO 190753Z AUTO 00000KT 4SM BR CLR 11/10 A3029 RMK AO2 SLP255 T01060100 401940100   KCNO – ICAO airport code. This one points to Chino Airport   190753Z – Time is reported in UTC. First two numbers refer to the date. Month is assumed, since these reports are persistent for only an hour, sothis means Jan 19. 0753Z means 7:53AM UTC, which is 11:53PM PST.   AUTO – Automatically generated weather report.   00000KT – This is the wind report. First 3 numbers report direction ofwind. Last two numbers report wind speed, with KT standing for knots. You will frequently hear this 0 wind report reported verbally as “calm”. A more exciting example of a wind report could be: 24010KT. An even moreexciting weather report would be something like: 31015G27KT 280V350. That means wind from 310 degrees (0 deg is north, 90 east,magnetic heading), gusting from 15 - 27 kts. The wind direction isvariable, between 280 and 350 degrees.   4SM – This is the visibility report. SM means statute miles, which are the miles you are familiar with.   BR – This means mist.   CLR – This is the cloud level report. Clouds are reported at hundreds of feet above ground level. CLR means no clouds below 12000 ft. A different example would be OVC002, which means overcast (OVC) clouds at 200 feet. Overcast means 8/8 of the sky is covered. Other abbreviations include FEW for 1-2/8 of the sky covered, SCT for 3-4/8, BKN for 5-7/8.   11/10 – This is temperature and dew point. Temperature at 11 Celsius, dew point at 10 Celsius. Yes, you will have to get used to doing Fahrenheit-Celsius conversions.   A3029 – This is the altimeter report. 3029 means 30. 29 inches of mercury. The altimeter reports your height above mean sea level, so it’s important to keep it updated.   RMK – Remarks follow.   AO2 – Automated weather station with precipitation sensor.   SLP255 – Sea level pressure, in hectopascals. Normal sea level pressure is 1013. 2hPa, so we get 1025. 5hPa.   T01060100 – Temperature and dew point, to nearest 10th of a degree in Celsius. So we have temp at 10. 6C and dew point at 10. 0C.   401940100 – Then we have the 24 hour max and min temperature. We know it’s 24 hour because it begins with a 4. So temperature high at 19. 4, min temp at 10. 0.   That’s it for this METAR. METARs are updated every hour. There is much more to weather, but this should give you more than enough of a taste for how pilots look at what’s going on in the sky.   You can practice listening to weather at KEMT, El Monte Aiport, by dialing (626) 444-1107. Most weather reports from KEMT will be tame, since it is in sunny SoCal.     Checklists   Next is the infamous checklist. I use an awesome checklist provided bymy instructor, David Werntz. His checklistis under Resources on his website. This checklist has saved me countlesstimes and is the guide I still rely on during pre-flight, run-up, andclean-up. We use checklists to help manage the complexity of the planes. Eventually this checklists and other supplementary ones will move into myhead as mental routines. For now, go ahead and check out the one David hasto get an idea for the procedures we pilots go through.     Details, details, details   Man, driving is trivial compared to flying. Rain, shine, snow, frost, etc, people pretty much just get into their cars, shift into gear, and then press gas. You don’t have to think about much else besides how to get from A to B, whether you have enough gas, and whether you brought all your stuff with you.   When you fly, you have to think about weather, itinerary, backup plans, weight and balance of plane, and fuel calculations. Of course, most of the time in training, these aren’t serious considerations. They really become issues when you’re planning a longer trip that isn’t just doing routine practice around your home airport or when you’re taking new people up. It’s overwhelming, at first, to think about all these things, but the process eventually becomes part of the joy of flying.     Delight   Flying is delightful. Once you get the hang of things, you will reallybegin to understand just how stable the plane is on its own. You willbegin to understand how little you have to do once you’ve gotten off theground and set to the right heading. You will understand what it’s like toreally have a bird’s eye view of the world. I love flying now, becauseit’s just that much fun to be off the ground.  That’s just a small taster of what it’s like to be in flight training. Shoot me an email if you want more information. "

    "title": "An Update on Life",
    "body": "2019/01/07 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com It’s been a busy couple of months since I last posted something serious, soI figured I’d give a bit of an update on what I’ve been up to. This is alsoa way for me to reflect on the past couple of months and mentally preparemyself for the next couple. Update 1: Flying lessons!: That’s right, I’m learning to fly planes! Caltech is very fortunate to have aflying club. I’ve just begun flying withDavid Werntz, who is a Caltech alum, former JPL-er,and current AACIT president. Unlike some other people, I grew up with prettymuch zero interest in planes or flying or air related things. I got interestedin flying after I took an introductory helicopter flying class in Seattle,during my internship with Microsoft. I liked being in the air, controlling apowerful machine, pumping adrenaline into my blood. Don’t get me wrong, flying is no walk in the park. You’ve got to know a lotmore procedures and a lot more about weather and traffic and navigation thanyou do when you’re in a car. But I promise you, the 10s of thousands of dollarsand 100+ hours you spend learning to fly will not disappoint, especially whenyou want to beat holiday traffic and fly to see family or go skiing or justget out of town. I’m still early in my flight training, but I will hopefully get my privatepilot’s license in the six months before I graduate. Once that’s done, I’llhopefully be able to use my license to make weekend getaways to places likeLake Tahoe, or Mammoth. Ah, the life of a pilot. But learning to fly doesn’t end there. A private pilot’s license is reallyonly the beginning of a journey in flying. Staying current, continuing tolearn, why there’s so much left to be done and seen. Perhaps I’ll see one of you in the friendly skies one of these days. Update 2: Blender!: I’ve started to learn how to use Blender to 3D model things! I’m sharing some of the stuff I make on the “Blender Models” page of thiswebsite. Enjoy! Please send feedback! I’m a beginner to all things 3d and artand would greatly appreciate pointers in the right directions. Update 3: Robots!: A couple of teammates and I tried to reverse engineer theParallax penguinbot for our robotics class. Here’s our writeup on the machine andtwo videosshowcasing our work! I worked on Bluetooth and fine tuning servo action so the robot would walkforward. My wonderful teammates worked on designing and building the robotand on the center of mass calculation you can see in the writeup. Update 4: Juggling: I’m going to take up juggling again. It’s one of those activities I cantolerate repeated, iterative failure in. It’s also a fun skill to have handy. That’s it for now. As usual, my contact information is at the top of the pageand on the resume page. Contact me with questions, comments, and suggestions. "

    "title": "“Never Compromise”",
    "body": "2018/11/22 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Compromise — an agreement that is reached by each side making concessions A compromise is dangerous and fundamentally incomplete because of the concessions. To concede is to give up something. It means to buckle, to unwillingly back down. That is dangerous. It’s dangerous because you will have difficulty coming to closure about what you gave up. It will sit with you and fester, and when the issue comes up again, that thing you conceded will emerge as a djinn from a lamp and make the conversation painful. The solution is to never compromise. Rather, both sides should seek to come to full agreement. You should truly convince each other or convince yourselves that the conclusion is in alignment with your principles and beliefs. Or you can agree to disagree. In both situations, you give up nothing. In the first, you truthfully changed your beliefs, such that whatever you came to a conclusion about jives with who you are. In the second, you also give up nothing. Both situations avoid having either side feel like they were treated unjustly or feel the need to hold a grudge against the other. The issue with compromise is just part of the truth where, if you don’t resolve something now, it will come back to bite you later. A compromise isn’t a resolution, because the compromise clashes with something of what either side believes. Until you truly agree with the compromise, that internal discord cannot be resolved. Let me give a concrete example to assuage any internal dissatisfaction you may feel over my words:You and your teammates are discussing which of the five features you’ve collectively developed is the most useful. Each feature group fights for itself, and everybody gets frustrated because no one else sees the value of the feature they worked so hard on. You could compromise and say that let’s just use whatever majority vote decides is the best. You could also make the smarter decision to agree to disagree until you’ve gotten data back from rigorous A/B testing. Once you get the data back from A/B testing, you may discover that feature B is universally superior. You may also discover that each feature serves a particular niche and that various features should be automatically set by looking at header data. Or there may be no real conclusion, which would imply that you need to gather more data or make a decision based on some other criteria. -The point is that compromise only adds to a pool of hidden resentment that will ultimately undermine relationships. The solution is to work at the disagreement until both parties are convinced of the conclusion. "

    "title": "The Therapist's Role",
    "body": "2018/11/02 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com The role of the therapist is to help his client rediscover the solution to hisproblems. I believe that each person has the answers to his questions,worries, and frustrations about himself within him. They have simply erected amental barrier of fear that prevents them from pursing that solution. To give a simple example, how many times have you confronted someone, evenyourself, regarding procrastination? Surely you and everybody you met knows thesolution: just get to work. And yet how often do you see people pursuing thewide, open path that is readily marked and available before them? Perhaps if youdig deeper, they’ll reveal all kinds of other blockages they’ve put beforethemselves. They’ll say they don’t know enough to get started. They’ll say itwill take too much effort to work on that thing. They’ll say they have other,more exciting things to do. They’ll say they don’t have time. They’ll say they’retired. They’ll say they’re sick. They’ll say they just don’t want to do it. They’ll say they’re afraid of failing. They’ll say they’re afraid of succeeding. On and on, we humans come up with infinite variations of excuses to allowourselves to act out the law of inertia and stay stuck in a rut. Here are some suggestions to resolve some of the roadblocks mentioned above. You don’t know how to get started? Well, most of the time, you’re completingthe project by another person’s request. Surely you have that person’s contactor can get his contact information and send a request for more details on theproject. You’re busy? Well, let’s take a look at your schedule and see how wecan move things around to give you time. You don’t want to do it? Let’s thinkabout your priorities in life and see how this project aligns with thosepriorities. If they don’t, let’s time-box this activity or just not do it. Ifit’s not a priority, you either shouldn’t be working on it or you should beminimizing time spent on it. You’re afraid of failure? It is better to havefailed and have a story to tell, experience to log, than to only have sat onyour couch and dreamed. Which of the above suggestions I have given to potential blockages are novel?Probably none. If they are not novel, the likelihood that you know them orcould come up with them on your own is high. The responsibility of the personyou go to for help is to push you towards discovering, believing in, and actingupon the solution you choose. I don’t believe one can change another person directly. Let me give an example. You are arguing with a friend about whether point A or point B is correct. Youthink point A is correct and have the evidence to back it up. Your friend haspersonal bias to agree with point B but has no evidence to prove thevalidity of point B. By the end of your discussion, let’s say your friend comesto believe that point A is correct and that point B is false. To simplify thesituation, let there be no ambiguity about whether your friend actually believesin and understands the reasoning for point A. He has completely converted topoint A. I don’t believe this conversion occurred directly through you. Atsome point in the conversation, your friend sifted through all the evidencehe’s seen, all the evidence you’ve given him, and decided that point A waslogically more sound. Some light bulb went off in his mind, and he had a momentof insight that point A was in the direction of truth. If this example doesn’tmake sense, think of the last time something just “clicked” for you. It couldbe a time when you understood a difficult proof or understood special relativityor figured out what some joke meant. The point I’m trying to make is thatin every situation where transfer of information results in a light bulb goingoff, the information giver’s responsibility was to set up the informationreceiver to flip the switch themselves. If you follow the previous paragraph, then it should become clear why I believethe therapist’s role is to help his client rediscover the solution to hisproblems. The therapist cannot change his client. His client must changehimself. The best therapist is one who can help his client make that jump tochange himself most efficiently and with the most long-lasting results. "

    "title": "The Teacher's Role",
    "body": "2018/11/02 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com This post is related to my previous post aboutthe therapist’s role. In the end of my previous post, I introduced a mechanism for teaching:  [I]n every situation where transfer of information results in a light bulbgoing off, the information giver’s responsibility was to set up the informationreceiver to flip the switch themselves. As someone once described it on Hackernews, the teacher’s responsibility is toset up the student such that his pull function will work when the teacher pushes. Learning is a highly individual process precisely because of the mechanism Ijust described above. Each person’s pull will work in different situations. Thedifferent situation may be triggered by time. A younger you may not understandwhat you understand now. A different situation could be learning environment. Trying to read Shakespeare on a car when you’re prone to car-sickness isharder than trying to understand it when stationary. A different situation couldbe the teacher. Trying to understand a teacher who writes up a bunch offormulas and waits for you to discover the connection between them is harderthan understanding a teacher who walks you through the nontrivial foundationalsteps that define the transitions and relationships between formulas. That is why it is so important to understand what you are missing when you tryexecute a pull and you fail. If you want a teacher, it is important to findsomeone who can identify what waypoints you are missing and build them suchthat you can make the necessary connections. If you want to be a teacher, youmust develop this ability to understand waypoints and how to build them suchthat people can draw paths between a starting foundation of knowledge to atarget base of new knowledge. Now I want to flesh out this theory of waypoints, or stepping stones. In orderto build knowledge, you must have an appropriate path to follow. You also have aradius of understanding for each topic. Let us say that you are trying to understand calculus from algebra. You shouldhave a good understand of variables and symbolic manipulation, but you willneed to move more carefully to understand limits, which underlie calculus. What we can say is that you have a wide field of view when performing symboliccalculations but a narrow field of view when reasoning about limits. Thus,in order to traverse the nonphysical world of mathematics from algebra tocalculus, you will need to take many, small steps across many, small steppingstones (or bypass many waypoints that are close together) to reach yourdestination. When a teacher goes too slowly, that means they are consistently steppingwithin your radius of understanding. When a teacher goes too fast, that meansthey have consistently stepped outside of your radius of understanding withoutplacing the appropriate stepping stones to guide you to a new position ofunderstanding. Points on the frontier of your level of understanding are thingsthat you should be able to create your own waypoints to. Stepping consistentlyon the frontier and giving you time to build waypoints of understanding shouldbe within your competency. Repeatedly stepping outside your radius then comingback to build waypoints should also be within your flow. As a teacher, your responsibility is to determine each student’s radius andset of waypoints such that you can effectively build connections between theircurrent set of waypoints to a new set of waypoints. A good teacher should beable to construct multiple paths between the current set of waypoints to a newset of waypoints, with each path representing a new way of understanding aconcept. As a student, your responsibility is to improve the speed at which you can buildwaypoints, to strengthen existing waypoints, and to build new connectionsbetween waypoints. One excellent example of building new connections orof strengthening existing waypoints is in Eric Jang’s excellent post onDijkstra’s in Disguise. Forsome people who already knew the connections between shortest path finding andQ-learning and ray-tracing, this post helps reinforce those connections. Forthose who didn’t already have these connections, this serves to build newconnections and create robustness in their knowledge graphs. The more ways youcan explain and understand a concept, the better you understand it. I hope this post explained a useful way to understand teaching (and it’s dual,learning) and to improve at it. I welcome feedback through email. "

    "title": "The Fundamental Problem with Economics",
    "body": "2018/10/15 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Economics, as defined by Wikipedia,is the social science that studies the production, distribution, andconsumption of goods and services. So,economics is effectively a study ofresource allocation. And yet, isn’t it ironic that economics can’t solveproblems like war, poverty, homelessness, rising housing prices, unemployment,natural resource allocation, climate change, stagnation and collapse of thehinterlands or rural areas, hunger, even though all those problems arearguably just resource allocation issues? So we are clear about how the aboveproblems mentioned are resource allocation problems, I’m going to spell itout below:  War: Fight over resources like people, land, oil, water, money, power.  Poverty: Uneven distribution of financial resources.  Homelessness: Uneven distribution of financial and housing resources.  Rising housing prices: Uneven distribution of population.  Unemployment: Uneven distribution of financial resources and opportunity.  Natural resource allocation: Uneven distribution of natural resources.  Climate change: Improper management of natural resources, primarily causedby excessive use.  Stagnation and collapse of rural areas: Uneven distribution of wealth acrosslandmass which causes people to mass migrate to cities and aggravaterising housing prices, unemployment, homeslessn, and poverty.  Hunger: Uneven distribution of food resources. Is it clear now that economics, for all the Nobel Prizes that have beenawarded to scholars of the field, and for all the priority it takes in theminds of our government, has failed to serve society. Why has economics failed? What fundamental assumptions has economics made thathave distorted its models? It has ignored the humanity of its subjects. Ithas ignored fundamental human needs and desires and sought to capture us ascomputers. Rather than speak of motivation or desire for purpose andfulfillment, economics has quantified our decision-making process intocost-benefit analysis or utility calculations. Rather than understand limitsto growth and place appropriate priorities on what we should be growing,economics has placed growth on the central pedestal and urged, no, demandedthat governments, businesses, all entities worship growth as the centralengine for their existences. And what growth is valued? Growth of numbers!We’re talking numbers like income, revenue, headcount, MAU. But the ultimatenumber is income growth! We want to see consistent 50% revenue, income,MAU growth because how else could a business be healthy and happy if itweren’t growing? To stagnate is the lot of old people, and we all know howthey end up. Just as it is reductionist and insufficient to quantify performance of amachine learning model with one error statstic, it is insufficient toquantify progress and contribution to society by the one metric of growth oreven the two metrics of growth and size. Have you ever considered itparadoxical that, the bigger companies get, the more they want to developsmall subunits? They realize that at some point, the energy required tomaintain a large system outstrips the benefit of the large structure and thatso-called economies of scale disappear beyond a certain size. So they split,and they split, because they want to stay small and scrappy. They want to keepup with the young upstarts that are threatening their monopolies. They wantto feel young and alive again. But the drive for small is driven by productivity numbers. It disregardsthe real reason to be small: to allow for each member of the group tocontribute in a significant way towards the group’s objective. If you believe that teamwork can be defined as individual commitment towardsa group effort then surely you realize that you cannot inspire individualcommitment with Powerpoints about group productivity. People become motivatedwhen they believe in the objective. Motivation must spring towards anobjective. Thus, in order to effectively inspire, form, and lead groups toachieve great things, you must identify and clearly communicate thefundamental objectives. You must ask that each person commits to the projecton the basis of alignment of objectives with personal priorities. Only thenwill you get true commitment and progress. This is precisely the kind of human behavior that economics ignores. Itdisregards the contribution of a community leader towards morale and communitycohesion because his productivity cannot be quantified. You cannot run A/Btests on having this leader or not having this leader because people changearound and in between the leadership changes. There is no control groupbecause people are complicated, and unexpected, and this is what makes peoplebeautiful and wonderful. And, again, economics seeks to harden people’shearts, to encourage them to view the world in terms of base calculations ofutility, to accept selfishness, to believe that incentives are what createsbehavior, to encourage greed, and to discourage long-term thinking. Economicsdraws people away from the higher values in life. In fact, economicsdiscourages the construction of such hierarchies of good and bad in life,preferring the spectrum of relativism that utilitarianism and discountingcan provide. Rather than pursuing a goal based on higher values ofbeauty, love, compassion, brotherhood, sustainability, or stewardship,economics asks that you put away your humanity (not your cell phone) so youcan make “rational” decisions. It is this thinking that has plagued us for too long. We are rapidly losingour natural environment. We are rapidly depleting natural resources. We havelost the good-old-fashioned values of decades past. We have lost trust. We havelost compassion. We have become enamored with competition. We have lostthe American Dream. We have lost the family. We have lost all that feeds oursouls, all that really matters to us, in favor of what? More money? Biggercities that are plagued with disease, filth, homelessness, aloofness,coldness, loneliness, unemployment, indifference, poverty? Overcrowdedvacation destinations like Hawaii, Jamaica, Tahiti, Aspen? Longer hours?More wars? An increase in exitenstial crises? An increase in belief inpointlessness in life? Increase in terrorism and corruption? If these aren’t the things you value, you can begin to turn around your lifeby simply choosing to pursue those things which will truly give youpersonal fulfillment. It’s not death that you should fear; it’s living a badlife that should keep you up at night. "

This is not to say that you can’t become 10x, as James Altucherdid when he became a Chess Grandmaster ~30 years old.

Are you willing tosacrifice time for your other hobbies, your other interests, other pieces ofyour life, so you can restructure your mind to be as efficient as possiblefor some activity? Of course, it’s possible for you to become 10x in anything. What will happenin the middle, though, is that you will discover a fundamentalreason to hate the activity or you will get very invested into the actvitiyand continually find reasons to believe the activity is beautiful or you willrealize that you can’t stack up against all the other professionals competingfor top spots and give up on seriously pursing 10x-ness. All these outcomesare fine, because I think the ultimate goal of your life must be to discoverand achieve personal fulfillment. If the current activity can’t do thatfor you, you should keep searching. Search until your work becomes somethingthat you can put motivation against and until the relationships becomesomething that can feed your motivation. "

Start:What I’m trying to do is to up my skills so I can get to live likeroyaltyDon’t tell me you’re adding value to societyI can see from the car you drive you ain’t worth more than povertySo don’t go walking around like you high on some fumesWe all know that stuff bad for you because it just subsumesYour brain and then your mind starts going down the drainUntil there’s nothing left at the end of this refrain We all trying to find meaning in lifeFor some of us, that means taking a wifeYoking yourself to each other, thinking that will end your strifeY’all saying you hate working the 8 to 5 grindYou would rather sit around thinking you’re one of a kindHoping one day to findThe golden ticket that will get you out of this bind Let me tell you your thinking’s gone off the tracksThat’s right I’m calling you a bunch of whacksY’all sitting there with bottles of JackPretending you in the corner office, hang your jacket up on the rackWhen will you wake up and realize that you’re wasting your lifeStop spending 10 hours on work a day it’s pumped you full of spiteYou’re angry and you hate it but you do it for the payIs the pay gonna save your soul when you’re 80 and grey?Will it make your grandkids proud or will they say “go away”And will you see in their eyes that glimmer of yesterdayWhen you were still full of hope and chasin’ after destiny(pronounce more destin-ay for rhyme) When did you forget that essential formula for meaning in lifeIt tells us that work and relationships are our bedrockEverything else just distracts from what’s rightDon’t think you can get away with delayed gratificationYour brain needs constant reaffirmationWhat I mean is you gotta put in the hours every day, prove that you gotsome dedicationTo your intentionsYou can call it your purpose in life but if you’re a kid you probably see itas doing what you likeThat’s right, follow your dreams, and hope that one day you will be given themeans to lead a team that will tear apart the seams of this regime and set usfree to be happy, fulfilled, and utterly esteemedFor work was given to us to be good for body and soulLet us find pleasure in applying our skillsIt will fill a spiritual holeBut let’s not neglect the other part of the formula, we need to pay ourrelationship bills Your work is your engineYour relationships are your fuelSo don’t play the fool, garbage in garbage outIf someone isn’t making you happy, don’t be sorry, just acknowledge youstruck outMove on, seek closure, the world’s so big you’re bound to find someone whowill hear you outBut remember to close your mouthEvery once in a while because communication’s on a single lane roadThere ain’t no passing, no cutting off, only head-on collisionBut if that’s what you want I’d suggest you check your visionSo you can see the person before your eyes, and realizeJust how important you could be to each other’s livesOnce you find the right people you’ll be well on the track towards becominghealthy, wealthy, and wiseAnd remember to treat others right, too, because they playing this same gameon the flip-side of youSo be patient, be loving, be gracious and be grateful for your crew I hope this little jingle was useful to youTake a deep breath, clean out your mind with a mental Achoo!You can go back and review but for now just relax and think it throughTwo simple pieces, work and relationshipsJust like Reese’s, delicious together, unsinkable shipOnce you get going at a clip you’ll feel really hipThat’s all I got to say tonight, have a nice trip "

    "body": "2018/09/28 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com How do you decide what to work on? Once you are working on something, how do you know you’re making progress? The key things to do:  Develop a x-year vision, where x is something long-term, like 10 or 20 Understand what has to be true to achieve that x-year vision Clearly lay out what has to be done to achieve the necessary components you identified in step 2.  Identify key metrics that can easily tell you if you’re on track to achieve each component of three.  Divide x / 2 and repeat above steps. Stop when x / 2 is smaller than some unit of time. I think this algorithm, if a bit rough, captures the key ideas of prioritization and progress. It’s important to realize that whatever you come up with out of this algorithm isn’t fixed in stone. You should continually revisit your plans and make sure they still line up with your priorities. Remember, to not get bogged down in the day-to-day of your work. We humans do our best planning and thinking when we look at the long-run. It’s true that the day-to-day work builds up movements that form long-term trends, but slice and dice your time too finely and you’ll run into something like a Zeno’s paradox. As long as you are making progress each day, you will be able to look back on the past year, 5 years, 10 years, and nod your head with pride at what you were able to accomplish. "

    "title": "Temporal Consistency",
    "body": "2018/09/28 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Do you expect me to the be same the person now as I was one year ago? How about 5 years ago? 10 years ago? 1 month ago? Even if you expressed hesitation, your answer to all of the above questions was likely a no. This is because we likely all agree that people change over time. So why is it that people sometimes demand temporal consistency? Why do some people seem to never let go of something that happened 10 years ago? Why are you still embarrassed by who you where as a child, even though you are no longer that child? (This may trigger some of you to go down a rabbit hole about philosophical views on identity. That is not the focus of this post, so please refrain from trying to say something clever about that. ) I think this has to do with the idea of closure and relates to my previous posts on repetition. Closure, I think, is best understood as some satisfying feeling of finality. When you have signed on all the dotted lines for the loan for your house, you probably feel some sense of closure in knowing that you are financially secured to own some property. You likely feel closure at the end of a good movie or end of a good sports competition. This sense of finality allows you to move on with your life and refocus on the next steps for moving forward with your priorities. What happens when you don’t get closure is that whatever needs to be closed will keep fighting for your mental resources. What you must do is resolve the ambiguity underlying the ask for closure. Ambiguity is caused by a lack of sufficient information, so it seems the best way to resolve closure is through more communication.  But don’t forget that information overload is useless if the information is not effectively incorporated into the brain. To close the loop, communicate, process, and repeat. That, I believe, is an effective way to resolve many interpersonal issues, not just ones that manifest as issues of temporal consistency or closure. "

    "body": "2018/09/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Having google at your fingertips is useless if you don’t know what you’re looking for. The problem of intractable search space is not just a problem for computers. It seems to me that humans are efficient at searching for things based on local waypoints. Each time we experience something new, we add waypoints in our mental space so that we can find that experience and the related learnings more easier. Those waypoints are linked to related waypoints such that we can demonstrate good relational reasoning. For example, if I asked you what you learned in your algorithms class, you can probably jump to the waypoint called “algorithms class” then to the waypoints “dynamic programming” and “Dijkstra’s” and “branch and bound” fairly easily. If I ask you to tell me about what you learned in an information theory class that you’ve never taken, you likely will have nothing to say, especially if information theory is completely foreign to you. Perhaps the point to take away from this post is that you should continually exercise your waypoint-placing and waypoint-finding muscle, i. e. the brain. Unless you know what to look for, your access to Google may turn out to be useless. You don’t want to get stuck in local minimums, but unless you have a waypoint out to a related field or find some partial answer through Google that gives you a waypoint out, you will be forced to declare defeat. So keep learning, keep fighting, keep working hard towards that deep understanding and accomplishment of something that you care about. "

    "title": "Don't Open Email Unless You're Ready to Act On It",
    "body": "2018/09/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I once had a colleague tell me that they sometimes open their email before they get to the office. That sounds like a reasonably normal behavior, since most employees have an email client with their work email linked to their phones or personal computers. The problem with his behavior is that he doesn’t act upon his email. Later, when he’s in the office, he will likely reread those emails he opened before work and take action against them. Why not improve your productivity by only reading your email once? I find the act of opening, reading, and responding to email to be largely useless and highly disruptive. Work doesn’t get done in email (or Slack, as much as their ads would like to claim otherwise); it gets done off-line. Most work happens without explicit collaboration. People work on things on their own time, with clear expectations as to when all pieces must be aggregated for final review. What email does is distract you from working on your objectives and exposes you to all the objectives everybody else has. You may receive an email from people on some machine learning distribution list asking if anybody knows how to use the latest Azure data science virtual machine. You may receive email from your boss asking people to RSVP to a team happy hour for Friday. You may receive email from this week’s DRI (directly responsible individual, or person who is on call) asking for help resolving some customer’s issue with your service. Regardless of the ask, the probability that what they’re asking is directly related to or useful to your current set of objectives is very low. The act of opening email is also distracting. You can certainly search something like “rapid switching between tasks” to understand the neurological disaster that task switching causes in your brain. Email isn’t the only culprit; I’m focusing on it for the sake of this post. So don’t open email unless you’re ready to act on it. And don’t open email frequently throughout the day. Regulate yourself by enforcing periods for non-connectivity and focused work. It takes time to get into a flow, so perhaps think about blocking out minimum half-hour periods to dive deep into your priorities. Within the half-hour, you cannot access any sources of distraction. For example, that may require blocking your email client, your FB client, your Slack/Teams client, or YouTube. The act of blocking out distractions will clear your head and make you calmer, all good things if you want to make big decisions or get big things done. To summarize, take a step towards better mental health and productivity by not opening email until you’re ready to act on it and restricting your email usage. "

    "title": "When Things Keep Repeating Themselves (General)",
    "body": "2018/09/14 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com A broken record that keeps repeating itself is using the repetition as asignal that something is wrong. People who keep repeating themselves to youare signaling that they don’t feel they are being heard. Repeatedly failinga class signals that you haven’t actually learned any more from the subsequentiterations than you did on the first. Walking down the same path in a mazesignals that you are lost and that no, you shouldn’t have made a left at thatintersection. When your life keeps repeating itself, it’s a signal that youare neglecting something important, something critical to your happiness andfulfillment and productivity. What are examples of your life repeating itself? Setting the same resolutionevery year on Jan 1 and never achieving it. Telling yourself to quit your joband open that bake shop you’ve always wanted to have every time your managersays you’re not in line for promotion. Saying you’ll start going to gym, startgetting fit, every time you see that gym membership fee on your monthlycredit card statement. When you keep feeling like you’re lost in life and youkeep hearing the same advice on how to get unlost. When things keep repeating themselves, it’s time for you to slow down. Youneed to figure out why these things keep happening to you and why you keepignoring their messages. Are you better off for ignoring them? Then move onand stop trying to repeat things fruitlessly. Are you worse off for ignoringthem? Then take the appropriate action and work towards a better life. Youhave all the resources you need before you. You know what to do. So just doit. It is easier said than done to accomplish such a feat, but perhaps here isalso a good time to remind you of your priorities. You don’t have to doeverything everybody else thinks is good for you. You don’t have to becomevegetarian and do yoga and lift heavy weights and play basketball if you don’tsee those activites as priorities. You don’t have to do anything that isn’t apriority? If you don’t know what your priorities are, I’d suggest you thinkabout whether you have an itch in your life. Do you have some desire, somenagging ideas, some thing which can propel you towards greatness? PhD studentsare likely all aware of this. It takes, for most people, a lot ofsoul-searching and (years of) painful thinking before they finally find thatarea of the world which absolutely holds their attention. One day they’rethinking about how much they hate having committed to networking when theyrealize they have a brilliant idea for compiler optimization. If that itchfor compilers is real, the more they scratch it the more it feeds them. Theless they scratch it, the more it eats away at them. The scratch becomes thecentral engine of their lives. Regardless of whether you have an itch or not, the priorities must be thingsthat increase your desire to be alive. Once you want to be alive, the restwill follow. What makes you want to be alive? Your work and your interpersonalrelationships. So focus on cultivating good relationships and on findingfulfilling work. Once you have found what you need, nurture and develop andrefine them further so you wake up every day more energized than the previous. That is the way to live a good life. "

    "title": "Defining Your Life",
    "body": "2018/09/13 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I recently came to the conclusion that there are two things that define yourlife:  Your work Your interpersonal relationshipsYour work is the central engine of your life. It is the reason you get upin the morning. It is the process by which you fulfill your desire forimprovement. Your interpersonal relationships fuel you. The people around you breakdown your mental barriers, support you when you feel scared or weak, helpyou up onto their shoulders so you can see farther, and give you the energyto fight another day. Perhaps some of you will look at this and think I’m naive or delusional. “Work? Bah, I hate my job. My boss has the brain of a goldfish and I’mbarely making ends meet. My spouse hates me for spending so much time at workbut what can I do? I’m practically chained to my desk, doing menial‘knowledge’ tasks for the company. ” Perhaps my implicit assumption of yourwork being fulfilling or satisfying was naive. I am well aware of howmiserable the stereotypical worker is. I have been in that position inmany previous positions and give you my hope. I hope you will one day find away to transcend your suffering and dive deep into your real work. This shouldbe the work that you develop out of an itch, let’s say. We all have such anitch. We all have an itch to change the way things are, to live a better life,to excel. So scratch that itch. Only when you start scratching that itchare you going to realize if that itch is real. Only when you start scratchingthat real itch are you going to realize how deep that itch is, and how thatitch can only be satisfied by your deep work against it. Once youstart scratching that real itch, you will start to brush up against peopleyou never had access to before. You will, through your work, start angeringpeople, inspiring people, touching people, changing people, overallmaking an impact on people. And their words will fuel you. You will take theiranger, their love, their energy, and channel it right back into your workbecause that is the virtuous cycle that the work that fulfills you builds. We have been raised to be disillusioned by the idea of work. We’ve been raisedto believe that an 8-5 workday completed in at least business casual attirein a cubicle farm with awful fluorescent lighting and a stupid but hotreceptionist is a job done right. We think that’s work. We think thatbeing miserable all day long at some job that pays the bills is worth morethan working our tails off trying to show the world why what we love matters. We mock the artists and people who pursue their passions, thinking they arebeing irresponsible to their families and to society and that it “conformity”or regression towards the mean of workplace suffering is our lot in life. We’ve been raised to be disillusioned about trust. The ever present smartphonehas taught us that time is no longer important. Bother people when andwherever you feel like it. Let them know you’re going to be late as you’rebeing late. Why does it matter? Humans can be trained to context switchbetween apps on a smartphone and computer, at the expense of their abilityto find really meaningful, fulfilling, satisfying deep work and relationships. We’ve been encouraged to view others in a suspicious light and to seecompetition as the global goal. When resources are scarce and demand does notappear to be decreasing, war must break out to see who is the fittest. It isin these arenas that we have forgotten the basic human needs that givemeaning to our lives and are the things we will want to remember when we areold and waiting to leave this life. So don’t give up on this life. Give up on the useless, even detrimentalmessages society has been giving you about how to live a proper life. Instead,look to fill your life and your days with activities that make you want toget up in the morning. Look to do things that actually increase your desireto be alive in a meaningful and lasting way. Hold onto those good thingstight. If you become dissatisfied, take a break. Step away from your lifeand think about why you are dissatisfied. Discard the items which are causingyou pain and pursue those items which you think could lead you totranscendence. It is no coincidence that all the great people of the worldhave talked about this idea of loving your work and about surrounding yourselfwith great people. Those, I believe, are the most useful factors for livinga good life and are sufficient to define your life. Other things you may think are important are hygiene factors. Here are someexamples of hygiene factors:  Health Money Living environmentIf the hygiene factors aren’t done right you won’t be happy. But getting thehygiene factors right won’t give you fulfillment or happiness. Where I differ with Herzberg’s original categorization of motivators vshygiene factors is in interpersonal relationships. I don’t believe truth isan appropriate way to categorize concepts. I don’t think searching for truthor the absolute right is a worthy goal. I believe it is better to categorizeconcepts as useful/not useful. The truth value of a statement may never beknown. Even if it is known or knowable to some being, why should I spend myeffort on an activity which polarizes people and encourages holy wars. Whocares if you like Vim or Emacs? As long as you are productive, use whateveryou prefer. Who cares if you believe in God or not? As long as you arewilling to work with me to build a better society, believe in whateverreligion you prefer. So who cares if Herzberg believes interpersonalrelationships is a hygiene factor or motivator? His theory is already usefulenough. This detail is a personal distinction that I think is more usefulin helping me live a purposeful, fulfilling life. I am so happy and grateful that I have been able to come to this moment ofrealization today. I hope you are able to find some meaning in my words. Please email me comments. I love talking with people who have read my blog andam open to all kinds of comments or proposals. "

    "body": "2018/09/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com There was some controversy in tech media several years back about Samsungcopying Apple’s iPhone designs. There used to be strong controvery about China copying the US. There has always been controversy in schools about students copying eachothers’ work. Samsung has since outpaced Apple on smartphone designs (and many other things)and Apple now seems to be following Samsung’s lead on some phone designfeatures (bigger screen is the main feature I was thinking about). Samsung isleading in OLED and general consumer electronics and Apple doesn’t seem tohave the power to wow its customers anymore. China is developing very quicklyand has estbalished itself as a tech superpower. The US now looks to China asa serious security and technological threat. Chinese students used to want tostay in the US after graduation. Now they look more towards opportunities inChina. Cheating in school will always be undesirable behavior. I put thatstatement there because I feel there is something more wholesome aboutcreating lists of three than about creating lists of other numbers. The key insight here is that China and Samsung were not mindlessly copying. They were studying. They were standing upon the shoulders of a giant ingovernment and technology and a giant in consumer products and design andleveraging the learnings of each group to accelerate their development. Productivity, output, impact, these are all words trying to get at the sameidea of a central measure of usefulness of a venture. The more productive youare, the more valuable you will become to society. So if you need to“steal” and “copy” your way through your journey to greatness, so be it. Justmake sure you’re learnings will be able to support you when you exceedthose you are studying from and make a break for your dreams. "

    "title": "When Things Keep Repeating Themselves (Relationships)",
    "body": "2018/09/03 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com A friend and I recently agreed to take a break from our relationship. Sometrust issues had emerged and we no longer enjoyed each other’s company. Anyattempts we made at mending the relationship strained it more, so we decidedit was best to wait things out and see if time could heal this wound. Just before we initiated the break, I noticed that my friend had beenrepeating himself a lot to me. Nearly every time we met or spoke over videocall, he would reiterate his values, his motivations, and his goals forthe relationship. I would nod and acknowledge receipt of his message, butsomehow he would keep trying to relay the same information to me. Each time,I would receive the information as though I was receiving it for the firsttime. There were days when I preferred to not hear him talk about his goalsfor the relationship, because I didn’t share those goals, but I neverinterrupted with: “I get it. You’ve said this a million times before. ” That realization, that he had been repeating himself a million times to meand that we had been stuck in this loop for several months drove my to finallycall for a break. There was a communication gap between us that probablywould never be resolved. Looking further back on our relationship, I’m not sure I was ever trulyhonest with myself about whether I enjoyed the friendship. He was a nicefriend, someone I could rely on as a weekend outing companion or as aconversation partner, but I’m not sure he was ever the kind of person I wantedto commit to beyond that. I’m glad we ended so amicably, but I wish I was more rational and honest inassessing the status of our relationship. The repetition was a big giveawaythat there were serious cracks in our relationship, but it was so late by thetime I noticed it. My goal for my other relationships is to be honest with myself about whetherthey are worth my investment and to invest deeply in them if they are. Peopleare all too willing to let you fade into the background under the premise of“they’re busy building their career” or the related “they’re busy with setsand academic pursuits”. By the time you have some free time, yourrelationships with the people you care about will have become so thin that itwill seem pointless to try being with them again. Our relationships withothers fuel our happiness. Let us remind ourselves daily of their importanceand allocate our resources correspondingly. "

    "body": "2018/08/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com People, Projects, Growth. For now, those are the three factors I want to optimize for in my search fora career. People (60%): People are the most important determining factor of how much youenjoy an experience. Cleaning dog poop in 100% humidity and over 100 degFahrenheit weather can be enjoyable if you have the right people to do it with. People don’t have loyalty to their companies. They have loyalty to theircoworkers. I want to work with people who are passionate about something. I want to workwith people who do cool things in the evenings and on the weekends and haveinteresting stories or learnings to share at our daily lunches. I want peoplewho are creators, who are galvanized by life. I want to be inspired by thosepeople and to inspire them. I also want to note the importance of good manangement. Good management shouldbe able to motivate and direct its subordinates. Good management should lookto promote or move around its subordinates to places where they are most happyand where they will make the most impact. Good management helps make thingswork properly. Growth (30%): I want to work on technologies that are at the frontier ofour understanding. These technologies are like our dreams. We have a smallglimpse of them. We barely know what they look like or what they do, but wecan see the possibility of getting to the destination from our currentposition. Right now, some technologies that I think fit this description are VR/AR,ML/AI research, robotics, carbon removal, and the future of transporation. Growth also refers to company growth and career trajectory. The company shouldhave ambitions beyond maintaining a legacy version of its cash cow. Thecompany should always be looking to innovate and research fundamental insightsfor a world decades into the future. The measure of company success should beits impact on society, or how many more problems were solved by having thiscompany around than by not having this company around. Projects (10%): What I am working on is nowhere near as important as theexperience of working on it. The experience, I think, can be defined by thegrowth and people involved. If you think you have a case for fulfilling these three categories for me,please send me an email. "

    "title": "The Economics of Spotify Premium",
    "body": "2018/08/18 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I recently signed up for the $. 99 3-month Spotify Premium trial. I figured,3 months and only $1? How could it not be worth it? The service comes withno ads, the ability to download playlists, the ability to play any song Iwant on mobile and higher quality tracks. Since my trial period expires in1 month, I thought now would be a good time to evaluate whether stickingaround for the $4. 99/month student discount would be worth it. The alternative to using Spotify in this way is to download the songs ontomy phone through iTunes or Soundcloud. I say my phone only because I rarelyuse Spotify on my desktop, opting to use YouTube instead. The ads areexceedingly annoying. In fact, ever since I had bought Spotify Premium, I hadforgotten how much I hated the ads, especially when they became more frequent. I was always getting trash like Home Depot ads for Behr paint or men’s hairloss and sexual wellness ads or ads about hard lemonade. I’m not male and Idon’t like drinking and I’m not trying to rennovate my home, so absolutelyzero of these ads are relevant to me. Oh, but the Spotify ads were absolutelythe trashiest of the trash. They hired the worst voice actors, the leastmotivated script writers, the most dull and conformist visual designers andmashed them together to produce ear-vomit inducing noises. I am beyond happyI don’t have to listen to ads anymore. I have only 42 songs in my playlist. At 3MB a song, that is 126MB, a trivialnumber in today’s world of cheap storage. Let’s say I download 5 otherplaylists, each with 30 songs. That is an additional 450 MB. I haven’t evenbroken a GB yet and I probably have all the songs I want. So there’s no concern over storing my songs. And, if I keep my own songs oniTunes, I don’t have to worry about advertisements. What about the value ofusing Spotify to discover new music and to create new daily playlists for me?I’ve never been particularly satisfied with the Spotify daily playlists. Song orders tend to stay the same from day to day and song selection doesn’tchange that much on a daily basis. I don’t frequently discover new music Iactually like on the Release Radar or Discover Weekly playlists, so thosedon’t add much value to me. So, really, I’m not paying for much value withSpotify Premium. Perhaps the concern about downloading songs would be an issue for people whoare on rate-limited cellular data plans. Since that is not the case for me,this point is moot. But, if I’m storing things locally, why would I everwant to play Spotify on cellular data? At $4. 99/month, Spotify Premium would be taking only $60 out of my pocket everyyear. It’s not a significant amount, but I don’t think the service is worthany of money, really. I can live with the ads and the lack of downloads. Ican deal with the mild inconvenience of finding m4a’s or mp3’s online and thensyncing them into my phone. I can live with an extra $5 in my pocket eachmonth. Your mileage will vary. Send me comments for discussion to my email. "

You alsoget no productivity gains from flying. You save 2 hours when driving, which isprobably the amount of time you could be productive while at the airport. This is definitely not the case when looking at traveling between cities likeSan Diego and Seattle or even SF and LA.

    "title": "Google Maps Vs. Waze",
    "body": "2018/08/17 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I decided to rent a car for the duration of my summer internship, so I gotall geared up with the latest gear for modern drivers:  Waze (all the Lyft/Uber drivers use it) Phone mount (I got one for the dash/windshield)I’ve gotten some questions about why to use Waze, as have quite a few of theUber/Lyft drivers I’ve ridden with. Initially, my excuse was that they used it. Then, after I’d accumulated some miles with the app and before I knew myfrequent routes well enough to not need the app (and before I got my phonemount), my excuse was that Waze offered a better user experience than GoogleMaps did. Since I didn’t have my phone mount at this time, I would have topartially memorize the route and then rely on the voice-instructions. For themost part, I found Waze gave me more reliable voice instructions than GoogleMaps. I almost never had to ask my passenger for help or pull over to lookat the map with Waze. But those almost cases really were painful. The almost cases were almost always driven by the application’s GPS gettingconfused. I would make a turn and it would think I hadgone down a different road. Or sometimes it would just not map correctly andthink I was a couple of miles away from my current location. In fact, thissecond issue once happened for many minutes. The road the GPS thought I was onwas completely not tracking the road I was currently on, so it kept trying torelocate me within the wrong vicinity. It eventually figured it out, but thatwas quite frustrating. Luckily, I had my phone mount and knew how to get tomy destination by that point. One last case of almost was when I missedturns due to not knowing which lane to be in. Waze rarely tells you which laneto get yourself in, expecting you to instead just know(?) how to positionyourself. I frequently made wrong guesses and ended up doing some riskymaneuvers to make a turn or just skipping the turn entirely. One worry I had while using Waze on audio-only mode was that it wouldnot give frequent updates when I was driving for long stretches on thefreeway. This would freak me out because I didn’t know if the app was stillrunning. Those almost cases were exceedingly frustrating, especially because I waseither carrying passengers or driving to pick up someone. The GPS would getlost, I would be lost, and I would waste everybody’s time trying to figure outjust how to navigate the remaining . 5 mi to the destination. By that point, Ihad commited myself to using Waze, so I just put up with the pain. The windowmount helped a lot, because the visual mapping helped resolve any lack ofinformation from the aural side. Yesterday, by chance, I decided to try Google Maps again. Waze was being slowto load the directions to a building on MSFT campus, and I was rushing, soGoogle it was. I was quite blown away by the experience. The first majorimprovement to the app was that it now gave much more frequent directions. Google’s main advantage over Waze is that it gives you information about whichlane(s) you should be in. I don’t know how Google performs on long-distancetrips yet, but maybe I’ll try it on my next trip to Deception Pass orRainier. One function of Waze that I don’t think is particularly useful but some otherpeople are fanatic about is the road condition reporting. I once had a Lyftdriver log every incident of pothole or police activity or car on the sideof the road during our trip. I got nervous each time, thinking that hersplit-second attention split would get us into a devastating accident (myfears were not played out). There was one time when this feature wassemi-useful. I was driving on I-90 when Waze reported hidden police ahead. Ilooked around to see if there actually was someone and was very surprised tosee a police sitting in an alcove, probably tracking everybody’s speed on thehighway. I ignore Waze most other times it pops up a report like that. Infact, I once got so sick of listening to Waze that I muted the app. I will continue to experiment with Google Maps and see which app reignssupreme. I think the solution for the people who prefer Google Maps but whoalso like hearing reports about police activity or potholes is to run Wazein the background but use Google for navigation. I believe Waze will continueto give those alerts. The phone mount is absolutely worth it. There was some debate about whetherto get a window, air vent, or cd mount. I chose the window mount that clampsonto my phone, rather than the magnetic one, because I didn’t want my airvent or dash to get damaged. I didn’t get the CD mount because I wasn’t sureif my car even had a CD slot. One disadvantage of the window mount is thatthe phone can overheat without the air conditioning system to cool it down. Another is that you may end up blocking your front view. But those problemsare all relatively trivial compared to the gain you get from using such agadget. It’s certainly made my navigational experiences much smoother andthus more enjoyable. "

    "body": "2018/08/12 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com 我這暑假搬到西雅圖附近的 Bellevue 時才發現洛杉磯真的是美國的亞洲吃貨天堂。想喝波霸，想吃臺菜，想吞麻辣火鍋，想享受甜潤的韓式刨冰，誒，洛杉磯都有。Bellevue 也沒缺很多，反正台灣的 ShareTea 跟 Coco 都有在 Bellevue 市中心佔位置，市中心也有幾家台式餐廳，韓國烤肉店也有，Hmart 有了，99 在很遙遠的 Kent 跟Edmonds 各有出現一家…只是沒有我愛吃的韓式刨冰… 還有，這裡的波霸比我們 San Gabriel Valley 貴一點。這裏一杯奶茶平均差不多 $4。加波霸要加 $. 50。想吃小吃或點心便當就得去外面找正式餐廳吃（但這裡沒有賣那種東西的餐廳）。還有，（在述說一下我的不滿）我昨天跟朋友去 Coco 一趟。哇，一進門就嗅到一股很重的糖味。我已經覺得波霸店是蠻低俗的地方，都只是無聊的ABC大學生會想去這種場所逍遙，但這種味道真是讓我再也不想進這種店。波霸店不用像天仁茗茶一樣標榜自己的茶有多好，有多高級等，但你至少要對你的飲料有一點尊嚴吧。你這樣這麼囂張地讓糖的味道變成主題曲就表示你完全沒有在乎飲料的品質。反正加點糖、奶就能掩蓋一切的缺點，對吧？真是不小的這些人到底在想什麼？我朋友上次去Sharetea 買了一杯波霸奶茶。她說半糖都還太甜，她喝到一半就覺得有點噁心了。誇張。更是誇張的是，糖、茶、奶精、波霸、又不貴，你們竟敢賣這麼貴，敲詐喔？難怪Pasadena 永糖水加味的 TPumps 受到最打的歡迎。他們產品有便宜有好喝，雖然茶葉肯能沒那麼好，奶是用奶精，但他們的味道能吸收這麼多人就證明他們也是有找出在這麼競爭的行業成功的元素。 說到底，還是去台灣、新加坡、馬來西亞、大陸慢慢享受最好。但台灣也在變，我今年春假回去一個禮拜，跟我媽去了一大堆以前超好吃、大排長龍的餐廳，有些實在覺得不值得。我們去過的幾家，唯有阜杭豆漿出人意表。那家早餐店實在非常非常值得。你如果在台北有一點時間得去阜杭排一次。如果喜歡吃火鍋，也不會因為價錢高一點而介意，那就去台北的天香回味鍋吃一頓蒙古是火鍋（就像小肥羊）。Pasadena 的小肥羊價錢不好，所以我很久沒去吃了。在台灣的天香店讓我回想起我以前有多愛吃小肥羊的羊肩肉。哇，口水開始流出來了。下次如果有人想去大吃大喝一趟，一定要請我去喔，誰吃最多，誰請。 後記：我本來因為天氣好才想畢業後搬到西雅圖，但身為吃貨的我不因為食品選擇不足而傷心。看來我還是再往北跑，去加拿大的溫哥華安營。 "

    "body": "2018/08/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I read something with similar sentiment to the following statement on Reddit recently:  “The first time around, buy as frugally as you can. Once you break it, buy as nice as you can afford. ” I can’t find the quote again, but please ping me if you figure out the comment and thread I’m referring to. The logic behind this statement is that you should prove your commitment to something new before you commitment your finances to it. The way you can prove your commitment? Through use. If you say you want to start getting in shape by running and you haven’t worn through your soles in 1 year, you’ve just proven that you aren’t committed. If you say you want to start learning guitar and yet haven’t developed callouses on your fingers from long hours of practicing or haven’t needed to replace the strings or buy a new tuner or buy a capo, you haven’t advanced at all along the guitar path. If you want to get into Fortnite or LoL or other MMOs but haven’t even completed 10 rounds half a year later, I have all the evidence I need to question your commitment [1]. This post, I think, will now become part of a series of posts on living a data-driven life. If you want to improve yourself, you cannot just rely on your intuition. You know intuitively that exercising is good for you. You know intuitively that you should practice guitar every day to get to a level where you can play anything in public. You know…and yet you don’t act. So you use the data to galvanize you. Use your calendar, your Beeminder, your YNAB to shock you into action. Once you start tracking your data and start analyzing it, you’ll realize just how bad of shape you’re in. And once you get into shape, you’ll realize just how much you don’t want to stop the flywheel of staying above the line. [1] In fact, I’m not just going to question your commitment to what new thing you said you were going to start doing; I’m going to question the quality of commitment in your character. One cannot serve two masters. One cannot split his personality into multiple pieces. One shall not split his soul into multiple pieces for the sake of immortality. You cannot be committed in one aspect of your life and uncommitted in the next. "

    "body": "2018/08/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Update (8/15/2018). Jevons Paradox:Increasing efficiency doesn’t necessarily reduce consumption. Can you think of any naturally occurring resource that is single use? The onlyones that came to my mind were oil and natural gas. They take so long toregenerate that they are effectively one use. Every thing else in the world, from animals to water to trees to carbon, hasbeen designed to be consumed and reproduced in a cycle. We humans havedisrupted that cycle. We have caused the extinction of many species,destroyed natural landscapes to fuel our growth and technical interests,erased languages and cultures from the current consciousness, and completelymismanaged the earth we were given to steward. There are gallant efforts in chemistry and materials science to shift ourresource dependencies away from non-renewable sources like petroleum ontomore renewable resources like plants. Many restaurants now eschew plastic infavor of plant-based, compostable plastic-like utensils and to go boxes. Plastic shopping bags have been banned in LA, but the rise of reusableshopping bags made of plastic, most likely, probably offsets the “gains” wehoped for. We want to make our automobiles more fuel efficient, but theirsheer size and the public’s desire for big, powerful, AWD SUVs is crampingenvironmental chemists’ styles. We think we can reverse the trend by plantingtrees, but we don’t think about the cost of acquiring a tree, raising thetree, maintaining the tree, and preventing carbon release upon tree death orharvest. The trees are a part of the natural resource renewal cycle. Theycannot reverse they trend; they can only maintain the current status. Wewant to reduce water usage, but nobody in the US seriously cares enough aboutwater usage to track it, enforce water policies, and really help save theearth. This problem of consumption levels and the futility of these carbon neutral,efficiency efforts is an idea that really struck me recently. Is thefundamental human misbehavior that is causing climate change not ouregregious consumption? Does anybody remember the 3R’s of recycling?Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. If you follow the link, you’ll see that the first priority in the wastehierarcy is PREVENTION. The second? MINIMIZATION. All my life, the onlypiece of the 3R’s that has been emphasized has been recycling. Granted, therecycling logo is a loop, so there is no real beginning or end, but thehierarchy makes it clear that again, “prevention is the best cure”. We areso far beyond prevention that we should have moved to the next rung,MINIMIZATION. Instead, being the self-gratifying, hedonistic, low-willpower,consumerist, materialistic pigs we are, we decided to go further down thehierarchy and make everybody take the easy action of disposal or recycling. You have lots of trash? Just buy a bigger trash can and recycling bin andpay a slight larger nominal fee. We’ll still take care of it for you. Youstill go to Costco and buy way more food and cups and everything than youneed? No problem, the trash that you produce, food and otherwise, is allhidden somewhere safe, so you’ll never know just how bad your contribution is. This statement will tie into a future post I’ll make about interfaces,especially human-computer ones, but I think we’ve thought completely wrongabout disciplining the populace (and companies, but let’s talk about thepeople for now) on environmental concerns. It’s surprising to most people thatbeing strict about principles and rules makes other people have more respectfor them. The librarian who asks the rowdy after-school crowd to quiet downand to not abuse library resources gains not only the respect of the otherlibrary users but also the respect of the after-school crowd. They know sheis a person of her word and know not to try pushing the boundaries with her. We respect people who have been through the Army because we know of theirloyalty and their persistence. Because they have been through such gruelingtraining, we know we can rely on them to give multiples more back to thecivilian communities. This is exactly the line of reasoning we should be taking with environmentalissues. We have no respect for the government and related efforts becauseevery year it promises more and achieves less. Everything costs more anddoes less. (Note that tech is the exact opposite. We would be appalled if lastyear’s gadgets cost more this year. ) We have no respect for energy companiesor the countries which hold oil reserves because they have demonstrated theirpolitical wiliness and self-interest. And, the public has no respect formovements like no-trash or homesteading because they’ve been given so manyfree passes on dealing with trash and waste. They’ve been encouraged toconsume, consume, consume, endlessly. If we were stronger about peopletoeing the line with respect to consumption and waste production, people willrespect the movements more. People can deny these issues because of all thefree passes they have been given. They aren’t really affected, is what theythink. Hippies are the only ones who are deluded enough to care and liveon a farm or trash-free. How can they raise their kids like that? I thinkthat, as I’m sure people have anecdotally discovered, that the more theyput into achieving low-waste, low consumption, sustainble lifestyles, themore they get out of their lives. Analogously, the more you put into exercise,the more you get out of it. Let’s help people create these positive feedbackcycles and realize that growing their own food sustainbly can be fun. Livingno- or low-waste can be equivalent or better than living high-waste. Usingless water doesn’t make you miserable. Riding your bike rather than commutingby car makes you more happy (endorphins!). Being outside rather than usingelectricity to light your indoor office keeps you awake better, fixes sleepissues, and helps you bond with nature. Humans are the only species to try to improve their lives. Beavers build damsthey way they always have. Birds sing the way they always have. Fish swimthe way they always have. Humans have taken their curiosity, ingenuity, andability, and created higher standards of living every decade. But the costsof those higher standards is crippling the earth which has given us theopportunity to continue improving. So let’s rethink everything we’ve been taught about how to live a good life. Let’s take care of our earth the way the natives did and are still trying to. This planet is, as far as we are concerned (the universe probably thinksotherwise), a non-renewable resource. I know people are probably going to hate me for not citing any papers orscientific, data-based results for the above claims, but I think some of myclaims are not too controversial or wrong. I will either find some articlesand put them in to beef up my argument or link to a completely newargument so I can preserve the history of my blog. Three degrees is all it takes fordisaster to ensue. I’m sure you can feel theh heat, especially if you don’t have airconditioning. What will you do about it? Here’s a nicely terrifying gif of human population growth to keep youentertained. "

    "title": "The Amateur Mind and Absolute Truth",
    "body": "2018/08/08 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Welcome to the August 8th, 2018 post. It’s time to educate yourself on vaguelyinteresting drivel I’ll scooped up from the bottom of the Internet. The first thing I’d like you do is to try to draw a bike from memory. Whenyou’re done, scan it and send out two copies: one to me, one to the guy whoruns this website. The best thing Gianluca says is: “There is an incredible diversity of newtypologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-drivendrawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100lifetimes. ” The reason a designer could not come up with this many designsis because the designer has models of “correct” bikes in his head. Thedesigner has been trained to know what drawings are structurally correct, whatstructures give certain ride feelings, what designs are in vogue, and overall,how a bike should be. Call these mental models limiting, but you have to acknowledge that thesemodels achieve what they were designed to achieve: enable to designer toefficiently design legitimate designs. A creative still has the burden ofcreation upon him, so it is useful to learn and develop models that facilitatecreation. That’s why the amateur can sometimes shine in exploring the unknown. The amateur’s mind is unburdened by any standards around bike design. Theysimply are given the bare scaffolding of “bike” to realize their thoughtsaround. The Amateur Mind, for all the “freedom” I’ve conflated with it, is reallynot that useful, though. The constraints a designer has and the efficiencytricks he has picked up over years of practicing his craft are what makeshim useful. Through repeated practice, you start to see patterns in the waythings are done and can really understand how to break those patterns to createnew modalities. That is a set of knowledge an amateur doesn’t have. Theamateur is crippled because he doesn’t know how to sift through theinformation. He treats all data points as equivalently important. But they’renot, and the designer knows that. Searching through an amateur’s mind is likesearching through the junkyard. The likelihood of finding something good islow. Even when you do find something good, refurbishing costs may make thetrip less worth it than starting from scratch. The second thing I’d like you to do is to answer the following questionfor yourself: Does Absolute Truth exist? Once you’ve answered that for yourself, take some time to readthis blog post. This is one of my favorite blog posts. I think back on it frequently,especially because I’m trying to resolve what are superficially conflictingphilosophies about work. The startup view on work is to move fast, breed the oxymoronic controlledchaos, and break things. The War of Art and Derek Sivers method is to focusand be slow, methodical about everything you do. Sit down, work in long blockswithout distractions, turn off your phone, turn off the internet, and crankout your work. Only through repeated refining against the grindstone can youachieve your best. The startup view on work is to have open offices and encourage constant streamof consciousness communication. Like the internet, the communication pipesare clogged with memes and other trash, but enough gold gets through thatquality work gets done. The other view is to have closed offices and givepeople space for private, carefully brewed thinking. I certainly have apreference for peace and quiet and the closed office, but I know there’s noabsolute truth to this debate. Microsoft and Facebook and Google and Appleall have their successes, with the office style being merely an extensionof culture that led to success. I now think the debate among offices is being treated somewhat like earlydebates about privacy on Google and Facebook. For themajority of people, it was a non-issue. But the minority who truly careddidn’t stop pestering others about it and now the issue has gotten somemore momentum behind it. I am happy to superficially agree with people whoare fighting for offices and quiet, distraction-free, strong separation ofprofessional and personal life workplaces, but I don’t think these issues arereally that important. My goal in life is to get ahead, financially,professionally, and personally. If the best way I can see to do that nowinvolves suffering in an open office format and having to work weekends andlate nights, so be it. If I am later convinced to follow a path full ofmeditation and closed office and strict 8 - 5 workdays, so be it. It isbetter to work at your craft and bemoan the pains of work than to bemoanthe pains of a work you’re not doing. But don’t take my word as truth. There is no absolute truth, as samzdat hasso wonderfully convinced me. The most important metric is how many problemsa strategy or conceptual map can solve. Of course, as in software development,the introduction of a new feature inevitably introduces a whole flurry ofbugs as cheerful companions. The financial system introduced a formalizedsystem for pursuing and managing greed, so we ended up with the massiveproblem of how to grow more, faster, better. Industrialization brought with itmassive population growth and environmental consequences. It’s a beautifulworld we’re in. We’ve managed to make it more beautiful and more ugly over theyears, and we’re going to have to pay for our debts, eventually. But for now,let’s try to manage the chaos and delay our eventual demise by contuining towork hard and achieve higher planes of thinking and doing. As usual, you can contact me by email. It’s at the top of the post. "

Why not focus on the real problemhere, which is … “dealing with humans”? The reason so many of ourwell-intentioned “turn around lives” ventures or ideas fail is because welet them fail. We gave ourselves an extra cheat day. We procrastinated toomany days (or weeks, or months…) in a row. We ignored the warning signalsand smart advice of our peers and mentors. We gave up. Don’t worry, the reason these statistic are as bad as they are is becauseeverybody gives up. That’s why it’s so hard to become exceptional at anything. That’s why there are only so many people in the world who are recognizedfor their crafts. That’s why you have to pull yourself up by your bootstrapsand start to fight back against the Resistance! You need to realize thatprocrastination and rationalization and sweets are all just horrible,horrible delaying tactics. They’re keeping you from building the life youwant to live.

You all have ideas for great startups or projectsor how to make new friends or an ideal summer vacation in Europe. The problemmost people face is that they spend too much time filtering their ideasfor quality. We all think our idea for self-stirring coffee cups (taken fromReddit) is great until we find that someone else has developed and soldsuch a product. We all think our dream to become president and fix socialwelfare is great until someone tells us just how hard it is to become acandidate. We all think our fancy startup idea to design boats that paddlethemselves is beyond genius (thank you again, Reddit)until we find out that we just thought of technology that has been sitting inour plain sight (motorized boats). So, with all these disappointments under our belt, by the time we have theskill or the money to pursue some of our genius ideas, we’ve lost most of theambition needed to make them happen. But that’s not the end of this story. You can turn yourself into an Idea Machine again. You can reinspire yourselfand turn around your life. The key is to realize that coming up with ideasis a skill that can be built with practice. All you have to do is to startcoming up with ideas. Just let them flow. Write down all your ideas, even theones you think not even your grandmother who loves you and all yourperfections would be able to give a thumbs up to. I’d recommend you hit atleast 10 ideas each day. Eventually, you will accumulate so many ideas thatyou’ll want to start acting upon some of them! The moment you start acting onyour ideas is the moment your life takes another step towards a higher planeof living. After about 6 months of coming up with ideas, you’ll have exercised youridea muscle to the point where you can claim yourself to be an Idea Machine. At this point, you should have confidence in the quality of your ideas andcan start sharing them with others. Don’t by shy about sharing your ideas. The more you share with others, the more diversity of thought you uncover andthe greater the evolutionary ascendance your ideas can achieve. Besides,there’s no sanctity of ideas. Don’t wait, get started now! Pull out a piece of paper, a napkin, a note card,whatever, and start churning out those ideas! Don’t think a did good job of explaining how to become an Idea Machine?

    "title": "Maladaptive Browsing for Books",
    "body": "2018/06/30 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com This post is connected to my previous one on browsing and divingdeep. Every so often, I’ll feel a strong urge to look smart by reading some books. At this point, even though I have an entire browser window filled withGoogle searches of various books I think I should read, I’ll start browsingReddit and HackerNews for book recommendations. This search for new booksis time-consuming, because I almost immediately start filtering books bytheir names or my prejudices against certain authors or certain topics andwill spend more time trying to find “perfect” books to replace all theones I didn’t think were good enough. By the time I’m done browsing, I’ve added some ridiculous number of tabs tomy browser full of books I think I should read (some day). And with thenumber of tabs now well over 30, I’ve started to feel tempted to use summarytools like gatesnotes or Wikipedia to clean up my reading list. Using a summary tool to replace reading books is a bad move because ittrivializes the gains made from reading an entire book. The author hasdeliberately used the entire space of the book to make their point. You willlikely spend as much effort acting like you know about a book you haven’treally read as you will on reading the tome. Summary authors may also presentinformation incorrectly or out of context, causing you to have a flawedunderstanding of the author’s point. Also, what are you so rushed to do thatyou can’t set aside 15 minutes to an hour each day to read a book? You don’thave to finish every book you read. Read 20 pages and then dump it if you feelso inclined. Reading is an intellectual pleasure that should be carefullysavored so you get the maximum benefit of an improved model of theworld and improved mental state. The proper ways to use a summary tool are to jog your memory of a book you’vealready read or to give you a sense of whether you’d be interested in readingthe full book. To be clear, my gripe with summary tools are when peopleuse them as replacements for reading the entire book. You cannot claim tounderstand the book when you haven’t read the entire thing. Even if you’veread the entire thing, how do you know you’ve actually understood it? That’sa question for another post. For now, I hope you’ll go find some time to curlup with a good book and open your mind to the possibilities of the writtenword. "

The minimumacceptable price is there is make sure you still make a reasonable living offyour work. What is beautiful about this setup is the level of confidence itimplies the producer has in his work. This setup also forces the payer tothink a little harder about the purchase they’re making and to appreciate (ornot) the craft they’re purchasing [1]. The only place I’ve seen this pay system applied is with Captain Games. Most of their games are “name your own price”, and the most recent three are“name your own price above x”. I haven’t bought any of their games, but I havea lot of respect for the developers for being so confident in their work thatthey can run this way.

    "body": "2018/06/30 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I find that when I am bored and have access to my computer orphone, I tend to desperately and stupidly browse. For example, I’ll idlyswitch between books I have loaded in my iBooks library (I removed iBooksfrom my phone a couple days ago, so this is no longer valid). Or I’llGoogle some question on Reddit like “best places to eat in X” and thenfollow more and more of the “Related/Relevant/Interesting/i. e. SuckAll Your Time Away Until it’s 2am and You’re Wondering Why You Stayed Up SoLate Wasting Time on the Internet When You Have 8am Class” links that are onsome of the major threads. Regardless of what the “I’m bored, let’s browse”activity is, it ends up being a complete waste of time and complete brainkiller. I have no more energy or motivation to get anything actuallyworthwhile done after the “browse until I’m bored of browsing” period than Idid before. I think the solution to this problem is to take a break (from digital media,especially) and then dive deep into something. This works because boredom is asign that my brain is exhausted or that it’s confused. The break is a timeto hit refresh and reset my mental energies. Dale Chihuly once said somethingalong the lines of: “It’s not the physical exhaustion that tires you out, it’smental exhaustion. ” I agree with that statement, but also want to note thatphysical needs can create the illusion of mental exhaustion. For example,people on low-carb diets often feel low-energy and sleepy because they’re noteating enough. Their body responds not with hunger but with signals to restand conserve energy. Once my mental energies are in order, it’s time to resolve my confusion. The only way to become unconfused is to go deep into the topic of confusionso you can understand where you got confused, why you got confused, and howto move forward. Going deep can mean more Google research, readingWikipedia, asking a friend, or just moving on. Sometimes you won’t understandsomething until you’ve experienced more. Sometimes you have you trust thatyour hand will understand before your head. If you go through the motionsenough times, things will eventually become clear. Browsing is a dangerous habit. It’s a drain on your mental energy and a waste of time. If you want to live afulfilling life, you should focus on what makes you truly happy. I don’tthink browsing will ever be an activity that makes you truly happy. "

    "body": "2018/06/23 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com It’s been a while since I’ve remembered enough detail about my dreams to beable to share them with others, let alone relive the experience. Today will bethe first in what will hopefully be a series of posts about dreams I have. Ihope you enjoy the posts. Dream 1:I was a young, male time traveler. I was attending some strange boardingschool where I had frequent access to the headmaster’s house and office. I don’t think I was related to the headmaster. The headmaster’s house had this large, open lobby with some kind of plantstand in the middle and four staircases going upstairs all around the plantstand: (staircases)=-=-=-=       =-=-=-=-        N ^        (plant stand)                   |                (*)(staircases)=-=-=-=        =-=-=-=- The headmaster’s office was north of the plant stand. The headmasterhad access to some kind of time and dimension hopping device. At some point, while I was in the original world, I was trying to help myfamily escape some bad guys. I believe the bad guys were the headmaster’shenchmen. I had led my family to a nearby train station so they could escapethe area but the bad guys, had caught up to us. One of my family members waskilled as they were getting on the train. I got nervous, angry, anddesperate to save my family, so I triggered a time and dimension hop andlanded in some other world. I continued to fight against the headmaster inthis world, and the next, and the next. The last world I hopped to started me in some square, pink room where a bunchof other children my age were mingling. I had defeated the badguys. I hadn’t aged throughout the dream, due to the time hoppingdevice always bringing me back to the time at which I started the dream. Iasked the other children in the room some questions. I think I asked about myfamily and about whether I could get back to my original world. These otherchildren must also have been dimension hoppers, because they gave me somevery reasonable answers to my questions about time and dimension hopping. At some point, one child told me that the physicist sitting in the kitchen ofthe house we were in could help me get back to my originl world. I immediately went to talk to the physicist. I asked the physicist to notconsider me crazy and then asked if there was a way I could get back home. He smiled and said “yes”. At this time, he pointed at some newspaper that wason the kitchen table. The front page article was about some boy who figuredout how a crystal ball worked. That crystal ball, I forgot to mention, helpedme throughout my journey. Someone would speak to me through the ball and guideme to all the tools or clues I needed to beat the headmaster. The boy in thearticle was me. The current year was 2018, and I believe there was somethingin the article or the newspaper which showed that I was originally from 1968. And that was that. Dream 2:I was about to head out with some friends in the middle of the night to getdonuts or some dessert in LA. I had reserved a Zipcar and was sitting inthe driver’s seat, waiting for the two or three other people to decide wherewe wanted to go. The boy in the passenger’s seat said he had a place hewanted to go to. He showed me the zoomed in pin of the store on Google Mapsand I asked if the store was in KTown. He didn’t seem to know, and I didn’tseem to care. I think I said I was going to start driving and that everybodyelse should figure out the directions as I drove. We started climbing an incline up to some large freeway sign that led to anexit. I believe we passed that sign but took the next exit because someonefigured out how to get somewhere interesting. The road was exceedingly foggy,but everybody else on the road was driving well past the speed limit. Thefreeway exit we were on was a large, curved loop. I was afraid we were goingto spin out onto the side of the freeway because we were going so, so fast,but all the other cars were going just as fast and seemed to have no problemsstaying in their lanes. What happened next was really scary. We exited the loop and immediately it seemed like the road had dropped awayfrom us. Everybody screamed, I slammed on the brakes, and we came to a harshstop in the middle of some road that was so foggy, we couldn’t see theasphalt. There was no one else on the road. I turned my hi-beams on and off,but they didn’t help illuminate anything. We drove forward very slowly for acouple of feet before I woke up, scared for my life. "

I wasjealous at the time of reading that headline, particularly because I’m also acollege student and don’t have anything quite so interesting to claim, butnow I’m angry at all the people who write clickbait titles like that. The thing that is impressive about this person is that he took action!The college student description is a red herring. Think about the number ofpeople in the world who have the same idea and the necessary skills and yetdon’t take action! The impressive thing about any accomplishment that’sworth talking about is that the maker got off the couch and took action. There may be a subtlety here that’s worth nothing regarding college students. Before you get a job and become a “real adult”, you have a requirement toindividually produce. You must show the world that you are capable ofaccomplishing worthy tasks on your own before someone else will decide you areemployable and invite you to join their task force (company). Once you’vejoined a company and are happily “settled”, you no longer have toindidividually produce. Your output as a result of your employment withcompany X is sufficient contribution to society. If you ever become unhappy in your current position and want to go jobhunting, you’ve again got to prove your individual capacity to produce. You’vegot to prove that you did something interesting in your previous job(s),preferably showed some kind of leadership or initiative, but are docile enoughto fit into the “company culture”. So, stand out, but don’t stand out too muchbecause you’ve got to work for the company. The paradigm I just outlined is no longer the ideal, as James Altucherbelieves. The shrinking middle class and heavy inflation areall signs that you now have to Choose Yourself (James’ book) if you want tosurvive. You have to take control of your life and build your own prosperitybecause otherwise you’ll get pushed further and further down into the pigsty bycorporations who are looking to get more and more out of cheaper and cheaperlabor. The fundamental ideas here are still the same. If you want to live a goodlife, you have to want to be alive. Start there. If you have that undercontrol and want to live a purposeful, meaningful, etc. life, you have todo something you are internally motivated to do. Once you have that figuredout, you need to focus on building discipline and getting that thingyou’re internally motivated about done. Once you’ve got that thing done,either continue making it better or move on and find something else that cangive your life meaning and purpose. Try to keep searching for beauty andQuality in the world. If you lose sight of those things, take a break andlet your mind recover. Remember that you are not alone in this journey. You have your friends,family, online presences, etc. to support you. Seek help when you need it andbe prepared to buckle down when it’s clear that’s the only way you’re goingto get out of a rut. If you want to chat with me about my ideas, please send me an email atipacifics@gmail. com or call me at 760-429-4377. Have a good life. "

    "title": "You Can't Fake Being Prepared",
    "body": "2018/06/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com There are likely 1% of people in the world who are so awesome that they canfake it, but this post is for the 99% of people who are mediocre. Every time I have failed to prepare for a presentation or a meeting, I havelooked like a fool. I think every time I have been irresponsible in such away, the people who were judging my work have been lenient. They gave mea better than expected grade (C to B range) or didn’t probe me too hard in thepost-presentation comments or gave me a warm smile and said they hoped I couldget the work properly done by the next meeting. Of course, no one is fooledby the soft passes. Everybody, including myself, knew I was underprepared. It’s very hard to fake being prepared. The number of times I have been given a soft pass on worse than mediocre workis alarming. What is more alarming, however, is how brazenly idiotic I havebeen in repeatedly taking advantage of others’ leniency. I have, to put itmore blatently, been lying[1]. I am absolutely ashamed of my behavior. I would like to be the morally uprightand respectable person who does what she says she will do. I want to get moredone in my life. I want to become someone who adds value to the world. I am currently on a journey of building greater discipline so I can pursuewith greater effectiveness the various directions I want my life to go in. My shortcomings in fulfilling commitments are high on my list of things I needto resolve to live a more ideal life. Here are some of my ideas for resolvingthis horrible, horrible habit I’ve developed:  Work in shifts. The Pomodoro method is a well-known technique that I thinkI will start tinkering with.  Procrastination is a sign that I need to think more or that I need to takea break.  Exercise is a great way to rejuvenate my brain. 10, 20-minute walks aresufficient.  Commit to getting something done each day. For example, write one sentenceevery day, even if it’s 2am, my eyes are bleary, and I just want to wasteanother hour watching “try not to get satisfied” videos on YouTube(I hate those videos).  Just do it. Literally just sit down and start doing it. No excuses, nothinking too hard about it, no more delaying (拖延）. I will post back later about my progress on this vice of mine. Now that I amresolved to be a person of her word, I promise that this updated progresspost will show up by the end of July. Note: Those who are judging the work of someone (or a team) who (which) is notproducing sufficient results should use the Five Whys [2] to understand whythe performance has been so poor. Make a decision on how to go forward thatis consistent with the work culture you want to build. Firing, training,and implementing new policies are all reasonable courses of action to take. [1] Read James Altucher’s Choose Yourself. Specifically,read the section titled “Honesty Makes You More Money”. Really, you shouldjust read James’ entire book. The first pass won’t take you long and you’llwant to reread it multiple times to really make sure the message sinks in. [2] You can find this on Wikipedia or in Charles Duhigg’sThe Power of Habit. "

    "title": "Hot and Cool",
    "body": "2018/06/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I was thinking to myself a couple of weeks ago: “Isn’t it funny how ‘hot’ and‘cool’ can mean the opposite thing in some circumstances and mean similarthings in other circumstances?” If the meanings aren’t clear, I’ll spell them out now:Opposite Meaninghot – having a high degree of heat or a high temperaturecool – of or at a low temperature Similar Meaninghot – currently popular, fashionable, or in demandcool – fashionably attractive or impressive I later realized a more subtle distinction between the similar meanings. Hot is used to describe fashionableness that everybody else sees. Cool isused to describe a personal evaluation of attractiveness or impressiveness. If I say, “Python is a hot programming language”, I’m distancing myself fromthe evaluation of its hotness. Everybody else seems to think Python is hotstuff, based on the latest StackOverflow surveys and on some other industrysurveys, but I don’t really have a view on how awesome Python is. To contrast,consider if I said: “Python is a cool programming language”. In this case,I’m imparting a personal view of how great Python is. If this subtlety is correct, then the similar meanings of hot and cool arejust an exterior vs interior evaluation of the popularity of a thing. "

    "title": "Traffic Laws",
    "body": "2018/06/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com __Traffic Laws__:I got tailgated yesterday while driving the speed limit. I wish people wouldunderstand that the speed limits are not suggestions. They are designed toreduce accidents and should be followed, under all circumstances. Realize thatthe efficiency of your car significantly drops if you go above 55 - 60mph. I don’t think the risk you take with your life that you incur by going 80, 90,100mph on the highway is worth it. Stop signs are not suggestions. Please, please, please, come to a fullstop and look both sides before you proceed. One of my friends nearly diedwhen a negligent driver cruised through a stop sign after only looking one wayand crashed into the side of her car. Turn signals are not a “do it when I feel like it” convention. Remind yourselfthat you are not the only person on the road. The other drives haven’t theslightest idea what you’re thinking. Could you please demonstrate theslightest courtesy to all the other drivers by giving them an indication ofwhere you plan on going? Could you also take the extra second to look at yourside mirror and at your blind spot before you initiate a lane change? Lookingin your side mirror is not a convenience. Your blind spot is blindspot for a reason! Please watch for your safety and the safety of others. Everycorner you cut off the traffic laws while on the road increases thelikelihood of accidents and so many other complications on the roads weall share. Please get it straight in your head to be courteous and decenttowards everybody else. If you are making a right turn, please move into the bike lane. Also, pleaselook in your side mirror to make sure there are no bikers coming up alongsideyou when you move over. If you are stopping on the right-most lane at astop sign or light, please move to the left so people can make right turns. You are not obligated by law to make a right on red. You should stop before the crosswalk before moving into the crosswalk forright turns. This is so you can check for pedestrians. Pedestrians have theright of way. You can make left turns on red from one-way streets onto one-way streets,assuming the directions line up. Please stop shaming people for doing well on their written drivers tests. When did not caring about knowing the rules of a dangerous activity becomethe cool thing to do? Please stop trying to seek the easy way out on your drivers’ test by going to“easy” counties. Driving test requirements are already very low. Pleaserealize how salient and painful the consequences of bad driving are and helpto establish a precedent of keeping our roads safe. Do not ever trust your car to Autopilot or some similar automatic drivingsystem. Driving is a dangerous activity, regardless of who is behind thewheel. There is not enough evidence that computers are actually better atdriving than us. Please pay attention, for the sake of your life and for thesake of everybody’s else’s safety. Turn on your lights when dusk hits, when it is foggy outside, when it israining, when it is snowing, on windy roads, and before sunrise. Even if youcan’t see better, everybody else who is around you will be able to see youbetter. I don’t know about you, but I think helping everybody else see youis a great way to prevent them from crasing into you. Take care of your car. Your car is a machine that needs regular maintenance. Check your lights, your oil, your tires, your battery, etc. Also know howto deal with emergencies like flat tires. These things are simple and manysituations can be dealt with just by paying attention to the signs andtaking care of things when they first appear. Develop spatial and performance awareness of your car. Learn how to park and get out of parking spots properly. Parking lots are aprime place for accidents because there are a lot of people and cars movingaround in tight spaces and because most people park with the front of the carinto the spot. Learning to reverse park can certainly help reduce the numberof accidents because it’s easier to back into a space between stationaryobjects than it is to back into a space with moving objects. Develop a senseof the handling and acceleration of your car so you know how to handle toughroad situations. Build good habits! This is the most important. Write down a list of things youshould do when driving and follow that routine. Check your seat, mirrors,your headlights, the AC, the music, etc. when you first get in the car. Tryto reduce the number of minor things you need to deal with when on the road. When on the road, make sure to pay attention to the right things. Look outyour mirrors every so often to check for people around you. Look out your sidemirror and blind spot for people next to you or just behind you. Lookout the back of your car when you back up so you can see what’s going onoutside your car. I don’t know when being safe became the lame thing to do, but driving isabsolutely a playing where safety is of paramount importance. A lot ofaccidents can be prevented just by developing the right habits. "

    "body": "2018/06/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com The fundamental criterion for having a good life is to want to be alive. Thus, if you want to live a good life, you must find those things which makeyou want to be alive. Every action is accompanied by a motivation. Your life also needs amotivation. The journey to find that motivation will likely be miserable, buta life without that motivation will be even more unfortunate. It is betterto earnestly try and never succeed than to declare defeat before trying. The human mind thrives when it is being challenged. Try to find somethingwhich you can dedicate yourself to. You need to find a whetstone againstwhich you can slowly but surely train yourself (磨練）. Don’t worry aboutfeeling like a failure or actually failing.

    "body": "2018/06/10 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Please read this Medium post. Changing Topic: Exploring is highly underrated as way of getting unstuck. If you are unhappy,confused, restless, or otherwise not at peace, you should start exploring yourother options. There is more to this world than suffering in the conventionalways. Everyone needs a reason for living. Every action has a motivationpropelling it. If you feel like you’ve lost that propulsion, then get out ofyour chair and go find it! Go join a club, start lifting weights, move to adifferent country, quit your job, and start diving deep into those thingsthat you’ve always wanted to do but have always put on the back burner for“more important things”. Just be careful to buckle down when you should buckle down. Seethis article for someinsight on buckling down. I refuse to live a life without ambition and passion. I haven’t yet foundwhere I want to go, but there will come a day when I will become one ofSteve Jobs’ “crazy ones”. Changing Topics: Realize that other people can’t change you and that youcan’t change otherpeople. Change must come from within. Every permanent change must beinternally motivated. You must, at some point in your journey to change, makea conscious decision about whether you want to go where you’re trying to goand whether you’re willing to accept the costs of getting to yourdestination. Only then will you truly be dedicated to the change. Only thenwill you really be dangerous, because you’ve kindled a roaring fire withinyour soul. You’re willing to go through brick walls and fight armies tofulfill your dreams. As long as your can convince yourself that there is hope,you will fight on. To get to a point where you can make that consciousness decision about yourlife, you will likely rely on the influence of lots of other people. Youwill likely also need to “fake it ‘til you make it”. For example, if youwant to get into a gym routine, you will fake having a gym routine byforcing yourself to go MWF after work until you have accumulated enough“going to the gym” experience points that you make the decision about whetheryou want to level up to “no longer faking it, but this still sucks”. If ithurts and you want to give up, don’t feel bad for seeking advice andmotivation. That’s what everybody else is here for. We’re here to test you,to motivate you, to reject you, to care for you, and to help you get to whereyou want to be. Never give up on your goals; just change them. Note: Don’t make plans you don’t plan on following through on. I believe that we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by theiractions. We use their actions as a proxy for understanding their innermotivations (kind of revealed preference but more psychology thaneconomics). People who flake on plans or who are late or otherwise throw offthe expected rhythm of the plan demonstrate a lack of respect for the otherpeople participating in and organizing the event. Note: The amount of time you spend with someone is a clear testament to howmuch you value them. Get sidetracked with me: I bought the 3-month $. 99 trial of Spotify Premiumtoday. One major change is that the app turned back to what it looked likebefore the recent update. There are also no ads! I bought the trial upgradebecause I want my music with me when I go on a no-cellular-data-plan trip toEurope next week. This way, I can enjoy myself on my plane and practice myharmonica against some downloaded tracks. One thing I recently noticed about people who are good at singing is thattheir voices are smooth at every note in their vocal range. There’s noraspy, off-tune, whispy, airy, otherwise imperfect sound to the notes theyutter. Most people can sing, but they normally don’t properly warm uptheir voices, which can lead to the vocal chord damage which causes theraspiness. I think singing is a wonderful activity. It’s a fun way to draw peopletogether and get them to viscerally feel things. I think that I will, one day,cultivate my voice more so I can actually experience the pleasure of beingable to sing beautifully. "

    "title": "Internal Motivation & the Inconvenience of Undoing",
    "body": "2018/06/03 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Today, I was thinking about how to create a better “waking up” experience. I’ve recently been having an extremely difficult time motivating myself tostay out of bed, let alone get out of bed. I think part of my reluctance comeswith the mental exhaustion that accompanies the end of term. I had much fewerproblems getting out of bed for 9 am classes a few weeks ago. Another partof my reluctance must have to do with my poor sleep habits. One problem Ican easily identify is my tendency to go to sleep late. The tiredness thatcomes with lack of sleep certainly draws me back into the bed and under thecovers for “just another five minutes”. Another problem is that I don’thave a good routine to get me going in the morning. What do I do first uponwaking? Drink water? Use the bathroom? Then what? I’ve got to find thatroutine which will prevent me from wasting most of my morning idly browsingthe Internet. One tool which seems to have helped many people with their early morninglethargy is a “dawn simulator”. I think a tool like this would be exceedinglyhelpful, especially since my sleep schedule is not so aligned with the sunthat I can just leave the blinds open. An embellishment that I think would beuseful is a speaker system. As the fake dawn starts filling the room, soundsof nature (birds chirping, water running in a stream, wind through the leaves)should also start playing. Some aromatherpy or smells would also be nice. Coffee is a trigger for many. Bacon may be another trigger. All of thesesensations combine to give your body a reason to get up. By the time thedawn simulator + sounds + smells reach their peak intensity, you will wantto be up and out of bed. That’s exactly the mental state I want to induce. The key to causing such a change is to realize that you are eventuallygoing to have to make a conscious choice to stick with the change. You mustbe internally motivated to create a different life. You have to getstarted on this path somehow, so it’s best to begin the change by just forcingyourself to make the change. If you build discipline and routinely make thechange, you will give yourself more chances to be internally motivated tolive with that change than if you weren’t disciplined. If you stick withthe discipline, you will probably come to realize that you can’t live withoutthe change and will then be interally motivated to continue living that way. Then comes the inconvenience of undoing. When the change is internallymotivated and morphs into a habit, it is more inconvenient to undothe change than it is to maintain it. I want to change topics and bring up the original context in which I thoughtabout the inconvenience of undoing. I was thinking about my difficulty wakingup and wanted to install speakers by my bedside that would play stimulatingmusic and help my body be motivated to move. It seems that the optimal wayto build this setup would be to embed the speakers in the walls next to mybed. Of course, this setup comes with major inconvenience of undoing. If Idecide to move my bed to a new position or repurpose the room, then I willprobably need to reinstall the speakers. At this point, I could undo mydecision and tear down the drywall to move the speakers or I could justgive up on this idea and set up portable speakers on my bedside table. Regardless, it is a hassle to undo my original decision. Another situation in which inconvenience of undoing comes up is in homeautomation. Let’s say you have set up your shades to raise or lowerthemselves halfway when you clap your hands. It is a hassle to have to getup to manually change the height of the shades if you want them onlya quarter of the way down. Another situation of inconvenience could be if youset up your smart locks to lock the house whenever you close the front door. What if you just ran outside to lock the car door and forgot your home keys?Now you’re locked outside of your house. What if you also forgot your phoneinside the house so you can’t access that handy dandy app which controls thesmart locks? Not so smart after all, huh? We just need one of those instances to occur for us to throw our hands up andgive up smart home technology. The hassle of undoing the automation so we cando things manually is so frustrating and likely will occur too many timesagain in the future for us to want to stick with the tool. But, there aremany times when automation doesn’t really get in the way. For example,consider the automatic brightness feature on your smartphone. When was thelast time you really put thought into the brightness of your phone? I don’thave statistics, but my thought is that most people haven’t really thoughtseriously about it, let along thought about it, in a long, long time. Or,what about smart thermostats that adjust your home AC temperature to becloser to the outside temperature? You probably wouldn’t think much aboutthat, except when you realize that your electricity bill has gone down thismonth. Or what about the smart shower that keeps the water temperatureexactly where you like it, so you can jump right into the water? You probablydon’t think much about it, except when you want to express gratitude forthe geniuses who came up with such a smart device. These are the caseswhere the inconvenience of living the standard, analog life is tedious andthere is little inconvenience of undoing. You don’t like the brightness? Well,it’s just a quick swipe to change it. Room too cold or hot? Just a quicktap on your smart thermostat to change that. Water too cool? Again, just aquick tap on your smart shower to change that. And you know that the systemswill learn or that the minor inconvenience you experienced this time is notworth jumping out of your pants for. I want to make some smart comment about automation and routines, but I don’treally have cohesive thoughts about this space yet. Some routines, likedieting and exercise, really could be enforced with smart devices. Forexample, you could have your food dispensed through a smart fridge orpantry that keeps track of nutritional content of your food. If you eat morethan your calorie count, either you can’t get more food or your fridge willtell your watch to bug you until you jump on that treadmill. If you haven’thit your macronutrient goals for the day, the pantry will only feed youfoods that help you hit that goal. If you haven’t hit your exercise goal,your smart bedroom won’t let you go to sleep (unless you’re sleep deprived,of course). These kinds of routines are painful to enforce, with or withoutsmart devices, which is perhaps why automation in this area has gotten lessattention than things like smart thermostats (or I’m just behind on thetimes). There’s a lot of potential for automation, but we’re just on the cuspof understanding human routines and the potential for human- smart deviceinteractions. I look forward to the next generation of smart home and smartassistant devices that come out. There’s so much we have to learn and aboutpsychology and the degree to which we can hand off our cognitive loadsto automatic devices. It’s such an exciting time to be alive. "

    "body": "2018/05/18 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com 我今天想跟大家分享一下我下午寫的一篇小文章。我最近一直覺得我跟我同學、同事、朋友甚至家人的關係非常纖弱。我跟我同學的關係最基本只因為我們念同一所學校。除了那以外，我們還有什麼原因繼續交往？我們離開學校，搬到世界各地開始工作時，還會維持著我們現在那麼溫暖的聯繫嗎？可能不會。你跟你同事的關係有那麼深嗎？要不是因為你們剛好選同一間公司，你們會認識嗎？對方跳公司時，你還會跟他喝咖啡，跟上他最近的生活嗎？尤其是你同事搬到不同州、不同國家去，你真的會花時間去繼續你們現在的過往嗎？我們根本不用再說朋友的例子了。 我有可能形容得太嚴重，但我看過太多次的範例，現在已經很難相信正常情況會有更好的結果。但我不要再耽誤大家的時間。以下的文章應會很明顯地表明我對人際關係的想法。 開始：我回到我懵懂的童年的基地。我們小時候愛玩的四驅車還灑在地上。自從我們那年生六年級我再也沒回到我們的寶貝基底。這次的重訪離那一年有二十年的時間。陳明的爸媽一直住這塊地，所以我這次的舊遊就拜託他們讓我請進我的童年回憶。 我們六年級前玩得多開心，關係有多親近。但我們六年級後的分散很明顯地表示人際關係的脆性 (fragility)。我們從那年開始就真的過各自的生活。從那年到現在，我從沒交過跟你們幾個更好的朋友。你們大家應該有同感，因為我們每個人都是過好幾次舉辦團員。高中畢業那一天我們臨時約會臨時決定的五年、十年團圓的時機早過了。 我以前一種很胃大的想法。那就是：「真正的朋友不會讓彼此的關係日漸疏遠。我們如果是真正的朋友，我們不會失去聯繫或忘掉我們現在這麼美好的時光。」照那一句來看，我們到底是不是好朋友？我沒忘掉你們，但我可能是第一個跟你們割斷聯繫。我們六年級到高一時還會偶爾打個電話或約會，但我到高一那一年就完全從你們世界消逝了。那是因為我必須開始我的「四年進最佳大學大訓練」。我的訓練有成功，但我永遠抓不到我那時放棄的好朋友的溫暖。 真是可惜。我們小時候的區別被時間拉的如大峽谷一樣寬。我從小就被媽媽逼去最難最艱苦的補習班。我高中開始的訓練就是媽媽逼出來的結果。陳明早就決定要繼承父母的農場。他現在做的很不錯，已經把父母的那小塊地跨展成這地區的最大農場。李果鮮從小就想當醫生。他現在在加州開了一個小診所，應該過個很輕鬆、很有成就的生活。還有那一對雙胞胎。他們家那麼有錢，他們什麼事都不用做，誰會預測他們用自己的實力爬到金融業頂端？ 人生真是稀奇。話說回來，我為什麼會想回到我們小時候的遊戲場？過去的事已經過去了，我再回想也無法回到那時代。我只是想提醒一下自己，失去的不曾失去。我們的回憶，我的身體有可能會被奪走，但我們的經驗永遠不會被奪走。 謝謝你們大家給我的美好經驗。真正的朋友不必是跟你長期經歷風雨的好人。人生的每一階段都有它獨特的真正朋友。 Not every question has to be answered.

    "title": "What Are Your Hobbies? (你有什麼愛好？）",
    "body": "2018/05/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I have a difficult time answering the question: What are your hobbies? I’verecently been inclined to say that I don’t have hobbies. But if I thinkharder about why I get so tongue-tied when I get asked that question, itbecomes apparent that I don’t know what a hobby is. I was most recently asked this question two days ago, by an acquaintance. Iwanted to give a better answer than “I don’t have hobbies”, so I avoided thequestion and said that most of what I do is productive. That got a good laughfrom the acquaintance and got me thinking about creativity and what hobbiesare. My thinking on creativity hasn’t changed since my5/9 post. If people ping me hard enough by email, I’ll elaborate on creativity. For now, let’s think about hobbies. I can’t remember which reddit threadsparked this thinking, but the phrase “things you would do anyway” has beenrolling around in my head for some time now. I think hobbies are the “thingsyou would do anyway”. For example, let’s say you really like weightlifting. You will lift regardless of what else is going on in your life. It’s somethingyou would be doing anyway. By my definition, weightlifting is a hobby. Hobbies can intersect with passions, but I think passions require astronger sense of fanaticism. It can be a wonderful thing when your hobbies line up with your job, but notevery hobby can sustain the kind of routine and structure a job requires. Thenagain, the discomfort I sometimes feel when structure gets imposed on anactivity I like may be some manifestation of my insecurities. You can oftendo more amazing work by going with the system than by going against it. It canbe hard to know when you’re right or when you’re a deluded fool who’s holdingeverybody else back. Do you agree with my definition of hobbies? Send me an email regardless ofwhat opinion you have and let’s figure out the best way to define this thing. Mention this post to make sure I don’t delete your email. 大家好，好久沒見囉！我今天想試試看寫一篇雙語文章，希望大家會喜歡！如果有意見可以給我送個電郵。 開始！ 我以前會因為“你有什麼愛好？” 這個文題而迷惑。我最近的正常回應就是：“我沒有愛好。” 但這樣的回答不但沒有解除我的迷惑而會讓對方也陷入迷惑。所以我這幾天在腦裡慢慢熬出了一個答案。 我認為我之前的誤會就是在於愛好的定義。我其實不太知道愛好是什麼神異東西。我這禮拜中又在reddit浪費時間時不小心找到了一個很精闢的留言。細節我不太記得，我只記得他有說一句 “things you would do anyway” （你本來就會做的事）。我覺得愛好就是那些你呠來就會做的事。譬如說你很喜歡舉重。你每天，不管平常生活有多繁忙，都會去體育館做一些舉重運動。舉重就是你本來會做的事，所以，照我剛才的定義，舉重就是你的愛好。有人可能認為我這樣的分隔不夠仔細，因為酷愛 (passion) 也可以用這一句來形容。我還沒完全想清楚，但酷愛好像需要更強烈的感情。你如果每有每天去練你的酷愛，你可能會開始顯出發瘋的狀態。 有人可能會說最頂端的工作就事那些跟你的愛好或酷愛對齊的。有些人可能會有意見，因為工作的常規、機構、系統會讓他們以前最愛的愛好變成他們現在最憎惡的例行。我想提醒大家一下，很多次你照系統做可以做出比你沒跟系統做的事偉大的多。所以你一有對系統有反感的時候就要好好地考慮一下你的想法有沒有漏洞。這種偏向是不是你個人的心態問題？這個分辨出你是對還是錯的問題很多情況下很難解決，因為世界包含著很多不準的神秘。還有，你很多次掌握不了你需要的資料。但你不要緊，你慢慢練習做這種判斷很快就會成為高手。你也不要鄙視找人幫忙的舉動。我們個人的力量很渺小，但我們合起來的力量有可能是無限的。 你們認同我給愛好的定義嗎？想跟我再討論這一個問題嗎？還是想跟我碰一下面嗎？給我送個電郵吧！請在電郵的標頭或內容裡說你在我的部落格找出我喔！ "

    "body": "2018/05/06 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Today, I’d like to share with you harmonica tabs for Ed Sheeran’s Photographthat I transcribed over the past couple of days. I am quite uncertain abouthow to exactly transcribe the bolded lines, because it’s not possible tohit the notes Ed sings without bending. Since I don’t know how to bend yet,those lines are my best approximation for what the song sounds like inthe standard, YouTube version of the song. There is also a bit of troublewith the verses, which should be lower than the chorus but is tabbed at thesame octave. Again, I don’t know how to bend, so I can’t reach the lower notesI would need to produce an accurate rendition. I also have difficulty cleanlyusing the higher notes on my harmonica, which is I why I stick so stronglyto the bottom of first position. I transcribed these using a Hohner Special 20, key of C. Let me know if youfind mistakes. I hope one day I’ll be good enough at harmonica to be able toshare my renditions of these songs with all of you.

    "title": "Indifference Between Life and Death",
    "body": "2018/04/01 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I haven’t blogged these past many days (not past few) because I’ve felt sucha sense of disgust towards my blog. I think most of this disgust blends intoboredom and apathy. Some of this disgust really comes from my conflict overpurpose. I’ve been steeping myself in a lot of Alan Watts these days. After I openedmy eyes to a whole new world of possibility with James Carse’s Finite andInfinite Games, I delved into Alan Watts’ The Wisdom of Insecurity. The Wisdom of Insecurity seemed to resolve most of my general lack ofmotivation and general feeling of dissatisfaction with life, especially histeachings on letting life run like you would let water run. One cannot listento music any harder by extending any one piece of a song. You can onlyappreciate music by letting each moment be ephemeral and dissipate into theatmosphere. I felt like I had understood his teachings and that by giving upon the conventional assumptions of living a purposeful life, I would nolonger feel so useless and bored. So I delved even further and casually flipped through Alan WattsThe Book and then read a transcript of Jiddu Krishnamurti’s “Can weTogether Create A Good Society?”. By the way, all these documents, except Carse’s, can be found in theorganism. earth library. Jiddu’s teachings were rather vague, but I felt I understood his questionabout what happens to two people when they start thinking together. I thinkthe answer to that is exactly the answer Alan Watts gives in The Book:We are all the same, that is, we are the universe. Once we think together,there is no division between the two of us, thus we must be the same thing. If we extend further, then we unite with Watts’ viewpoint and encompasseverything. Rather than coming into the universe, we come out of it, as apart of it. Beautiful, isn’t it, this view of universal unity? Well, it was until itwasn’t for me. At some point, I started to feel that if I truly believedwhat Watts was saying, then I would be completely satisfied. There would beno difference in my being dead or alive, because there is no longer anythingin this world left for me to do. I could, supposedly, play hide as the God inWatts’ The Book. Perhaps my conflict here is erroneous because I stillassume purpose in this life. To accept Watts’ philosophy is fundamentally toaccept that life is purposeless. Only by doing things for the sake of doingthem can we truly understand those things. Thus, only by living for the sakeof living can I understand living. And that satisfied me for a bit, but Istill felt like accepting this philosophy made me indifferent between lifeand death. So why bother living? Why bother preserving my life? So I lived, unhappy with my life, and without an answer to that , for a while, until I finally got frustrated enough to read Zen and the Art ofMotorcycle Maintenance. And that book really helped clear some of myfrustrations about the futility of life. One of the ideas discussed is thatfanatacism can only occur when there is doubt. One can only be fanatic aboutChristianity if there is doubt about the legitimacy of Christianity. If youare certain, nothing can shake your faith, so there no reason for you to gooff your rocker fighting people of other faiths or false prophets or falsebelievers. You can calmly and rationally and clearly explain your positionto those who are confused because you know truth will eventually find thosepeople. I can only be fanatic about life if I am uncertain of my life. And Ireally am uncertain. I am uncertain as to whether I will still live tomorrow;I am uncertain as to whether my life will be worth living. So I had betterbe fanatic about life until I satisfy that uncertainty. And that uncertaintyis impossible to be resolved, so I will remain fanatic about it until the dayI die. And that’s a wonderful thing, that I have such energy about a necessaryreality, because it means I will do great things in my time on this earth. One other concept Prisig discusses which I found wonderfully freeing was hisdichotomy of romantic and classical thinking. Pulling from the book: “Aclassical understanding sees the world primarily as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance. ”I think the hole I had dug myself into regarding my life was that I hadbegun to look at life too romantically. Life was just life. What waseverybody so confused about? But the really interesting parts of life comewhen you try to dissect it and understand it and come to terms with all thecontradictory ideas that emerge when you get deep into the weeds of it. That was the part of my life that I was missing. I had given up too much ofmy natural inclination for classical thinking, what people commonly term“curiosity” or even “childlike curiosity”, for a laid back, superficialview of life. I don’t want to view life; I want to appreciate it. I don’tneed to understand it to appreciate it, but I need to value it more thansuperficially. Another idea I like that’s from Prisig’s book is that imitiation is inherentlybad. He has this whole section on Phaedrus, this mythical being who I believeis him, running a no-grades experiment at the college where he’s teachingEnglish. The purpose of this experiment is to reintroduce real education bycultivating knowledge-motivated people. Those kinds of people are absolutelyunstoppable because they have real reasons to want to know and can’t stopthemselves from satisfying that want. Another motivation for this systemwas to encourage people to become more creative by breaking free of theirimitation-shackles. He wanted his students to realize that they could seefreshly without worrying about what had been said and done before. He wantedhis students to decide for themselves what was good and bad, what wasworthwhile and pointless. He wanted everybody to follow their internalcreative goals. He eventually gave up this experiment because most of hisstudents were struggling to escape from the vacuum where they were toldwhat to do. I haven’t finished the book, so I’m not exactly sure how thingsresolve, but I know that he will eventually discover a satisfying metaphysicson Quality. Why do I find imitation bad? Because it shackles the mind. Peter Thiel isfamous for the question “What important truth do very few people agree withyou on?”. Those who imitate will never have a good answer. Then again, Thielis in support of Rene Girard’s mimetic theory. I’m not sure how to resolvethis conflict because I don’t know enough about mimetic theory, but thesurface level intuition suggests a significant conflict between his desire forcontrarian thinkers and his support of mimetic theory. Regardless, contrarianthinking is refreshing and satisfying and is necessary for the progress ofsociety. Perhaps progress isn’t necessary, you say. I’ve certainly thoughtthis myself, especially because I was once confused about why economic growthwas necessary (as measured by GDP). It soon became obvious that economy was aflywheel. The more economic activity there is, the more economicactivity will be produced. The more people get on the economic growthbandwagon, the more people will be inspired to jump on and keep pushingforward. So it is not that economic growth or progress is necessary, but thatit is an attractive alternative to a world of stability. Will anyone reallyargue that our lives today are worse than those of the hunter-gatherers orof 18th century royalty? Perhaps we are philosophically more empty, but weare surely not physically or economically any worse off. So now my mental woes have been sung to sleep by the lullabies of economicgrowth and Prisig’s Zen and Watts’ universal unity. Write me if you havequestions, comments, or concerns. Until next time. "

Before I continue with my complete disinterest in “real” Japanese food, letme share some produce prices in USD, assuming a 100 JY/USD exchange rate:  Orange: $1 - $1. 60 Cantaloupe: $82 - $330 Bananas: $3 for 5 Apple: ~$10 Strawberry: $15 for a pack of ~15Some other produce was sold in sets. For example, a set of an apple, someoranges, and some grapes, perhaps. I don’t remember exactly the prices I saw,but they aren’t any less cheap than the prices I just shared. Before I talk about today’s disappointing department store meal, let me tellyou about yesterday’s food experience. Yesterday, since lunch was not included, I decided to try some Hakata ramen. I have no idea about the rating of the place we tried, since it we just chosesome restaurant in the Canal City mall behind our hotel, but I am pretty sureit was authentic. I was really hoping that I would get some amazinglydelicious bowl of ramen with fall-apart-in-your-mouth-and-perfectly-seasonedchashu, but what I got was no better than what I’ve had at Shin-Sen-Gumi inRosemead. I don’t like Shin-Sen-Gumi. I didn’t like yesterday’s ramen. I’msorely disappointed. Today, dinner was no included, so we looked around the Tenjin UndergroundShopping Center for food. This underground center is really a wonderland. It spans 12 streets north/south, and it probably has everything you could everwant to buy. We ended up going to Daimaru, a Japanese department store forour meal. Other people in our group split themselves up among conveyor beltsushi and ramen and baked pigs feet. I wasn’t particularly hungry, and twocircles around the department store food section didn’t inspire any appetite,so I gave up and bought a plain potato croquette and some yakitori. My travel companions chose some other yakitori and some tonkatsu(NOT TONKOTSU) bento and takoyaki. I don’t like takoyaki, so I have no ideahow that tasted, but the rest was uninspiring. Ah…I long for the taste ofTaiwan. I feel like the Japanese foods I like all have to be bought at a restaurantto be good:  Tonkotsu ramen (not sure how I feel about other ramen, since I love thefatty saltiness of hakata ramen).  Katsu Curry, especially with katsu Eel rice Nigiri and rollsJapanese bread is also sad. There are piles upon piles of bakery as far asthe eye can see in Japan, but I have yet to see a Japanese bakery that arousesany desire in me. Bread should have life to it. It should glow with freshnessand the life that the baker put into it. I feel like all the Japanese breadI’ve seen has been dry and lifeless. Everybody’s taste is different, but Ithink some things about food presentation and quality are universal. Now for some good things. I found raspberry Kit Kats again! This is by farmy favorite flavor of Kit Kat. The raspberry is so nicely strong against thewhite chocolate base. This version is also not overwhelmingly sweet. I boughtsome Beni Imo Kit Kats yesterday because it’s a Kyushu special (I think), butwas sorely disappointed because it tasted nothing like purple potatoes. BeniImo was also insanely sweet. (Apologies for mixing the bad into the goodsection). Also, the candy in the image is amazing!It’s so juicy and tasty. It’s also limited edition, so I’ll have to slowlysavor each piece. I almost forgot to talk about the weather. Today was quite cold. We went outto Yufuin, and it was probably near 30 deg Fahrenheit. Fukuoka, when it’scold, is no loser to Hokkaido! The rain held itself together yesterday andthis morning, but we really got some water this evening. We spent most of ourtime inside, so the weather was not a huge impediment to our travels. Now to talk about why I write a blog. I felt recently that I should stopwriting to an audience and that my blog should just be for myself. A coupledays after I had that thought, I realized that I had little reason to recordinteresting thoughts on my blog. By the time I have time to write my blog,I’ve likely already satisfied my intellectual curiosity about whatever wasinteresting to me that day and have nothing more to say on the topic. Thus,the only real motivator for my writing my blog is the potential audience Ican reach. I don’t know who that audience is, and I don’t care rightnow. All I need is to maintain this sense of purpose for an unidentifiedaudience while I write. "

    "body": "2018/03/17 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Note:I write all my blog posts on the fly. They’re not so unrefined as to bestreams of consciousness, but they receive minimal proofreading. I write this way because I’m impatient with my thoughts. Writing my blog issatisfying, but I feel at odds with writing because it’s too purposeful. When purpose has been used to achieve purposelessness, the thing has beengrasped. Things should be done for their own sake. So, I must write for thesake of writing. Every action is an end unto itself. To expect something after an action, likeexpecting someone to pay you back after a meal or expecting someone to helpyou up after you’ve fallen, is to extend the action beyond its naturallifetime. Nothing is more important than anything else. Note on using my words:Everything I write is free to be repurposed. Once I have said something, itnow exists in the open space surrounding me. I don’t own my words because theyare no longer of me**. Others are free to reach into this open spacesurrounding me and examine the items there. We exist in an infinite universe of knowledge. Most of this knowledge isunexplored, raw, and hard to digest. Many people before us have partiallysome of the knowledge in this universe. My blog is a repository for all thepieces of partially digested knowledge I have deemed interesting enough toshare with the world. This knowledge cannot be private, because it was alwaysavailable to anyone who cared to look hard enough. Thus, when I shareprocessed knowledge, in any form and through any method, that morsel is nowanother part of the common universe of knowledge we all exist in. I cannotrestrict you from digesting the raw material another way or digesting myprocessed material another way. Neither of us can delete this knowledge fromthe universe (though there are certainly pieces of processed knowledge we ihave lost track of). So, please, share what you discover in my section of theuniverse as freely as you wish. I do not need any acknowledgement. **I’m still refining my thoughts on ownership, so I feel shaky about whatthe previous sentence implies. My first inclination was to continue and saythat I only own what is physically within or attached to my body. That would imply that I don’t know my phone, my computer, my house,my clothes, and all the other material items which I am currently comfortableclaiming as mine. It is relieving to claim that I own nothing and that I amone with the world, but is that right? I am made of the earth, and to theearth I will return. The conflict I experience arises from everybody else’scontrary opinions. If I was to tear down all my fences and remove the locksfrom my house and claim that anything but my body is unowned, there would be ariot in my neighborhood. For me to be bothered by this requires that I don’tfully believe this philosophy. Which way will the tree fall? "

    "body": "2018/03/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Everything a person does should be in line with their priorities. A friend recently read a book which said, if you ask someone to do something, they will likely do it because they don’t have a plan for the day This implies most don’t have their priorities straight. We have raised people to brush aside concepts like scheduling or working hard or focusing in favor of hedonistic philosophies. People think of things in absolutes rather than relatives, and even they do thinkin terms of relatives, they twist the relatives to be absolutes. The superhero became popular and loved because of his fearlessness, not because of his ability to overcome fear. Top atheltes were admired because they held the top positions, not because of their ability to fight against lack of motivation, boredom, physical and mental anguish to get to the top. No one wants to know the back story because it’s too “real”. It’s not glamorous enough to watch someone train for four hours a day in the gym and on the field and in the kitchen and back, day in and day out. It’s not cool to work hard, because working hard is for the peasants who do honest work. The elite sit in their offices all day and play petty mind games on supply distribution channels and negotiation and office politics. And the people who are average? Well, of course they also aspire to be elite. And if you, the average loser, ever become successful by winning the lottery or inherting some trust fund or marrying rich, you’ve got to hide any signs of effort you put into “winning at life” because that’s what Robert Greene said you needed to do to maintain power. And of course, don’t forget to make snide comments towards those people who you deem to be below you. They just don’t deserve to be in your position. Make sure you close off every one of your piercing yet casual remarks about how “of course the world is fair; everybody else is just not working hard enough” with one of those fake smiles that is meant to convey just how much you pity those fools who aren’t on your level. And you’ll do this because you’re one of those fools who’s among the dregs of society but wants to internally justify his current success by leveling out the playing field around him. It is important to know where you are going when you set out on a journey. You do not need to be specific in your goal, because the journey will help refine your desires and wants, but you should set out with purpose. I was recently browsing Hackernews for some book recommendations and came upon a series of comments about Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People. (Aside: Why “win” friends? You could consider the act of making new friends a competition for another person’s time and attention, but this sounds just a bit sinister and manipulative. I think all the self-help books I’ve read, with the exception of Wooden’s and Andy Grove’s, have been quite sinister. Robert Greene is the pinnacle of sinister. ) There was a bit of debate about how good Carnegie’s book is because some people felt that the book was too obvious. I felt the same way when I first read this book years ago, but I justfied the time spent by saying that he reminded me of many common sense principles I should be applying. I take fault with the last sentence of the previous paragraph. If these principles are good, then I should internalize them and always behave accordingly. But, I, like most people, brush away the task of correcting my behavior by saying it’s hard. “I’m working on it. ” “Please bear with me. ” What I’m effectively saying is that becoming a better person isn’t a priority. By saying things are too hard, I’m also subscribing to the all too common idea that laziness is the good and common. “Eh, I’m lazy. ” “How are you so productive? I did nothing this weekend!” Give up this idea that your life is absolute. Every day is a new day. You are a changing being. Whether you like it or not, you must be at peace with the fact that you are growing older each day. You cannot grasp a single moment any more than you can grasp water. The harder you try to stay in the same position, the harder you will be thrown out of that position when the time comes. It is easier to constantly be moving towards something new, towards a newer you, than to try to fossilize your “glory days”. Give up this idea that someone’s worth is their ranking. Give up this idea that you must be number one. Grow to love the idea of constant movement towards your priorities. One cannot fight and flow at the same time. Your performance is a metric you must keep in your heart at all times, as a barometer of how well you are doing relative to your life goals. Before you know it, you will either be where you want or you will be dead. It is not orthogonal that one is academically accomplished and that one is a good person. They are not two sides of the same coin, because that implies a flipping akin to that of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They are part of the same, round, imperfect being. One who is a genius in colloquial understanding but lacking in emotional accommodation is only half human. You cannot fight yourself. Think of yourself as a sculpture. You can add clay to patch the broken parts or to add new abilities. You can also take the knife to yourself and remove inappropriate parts. Refine yourself on a daily basis; it’s fun. "

    "body": "2018/03/01 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt The current work schedule expects humans to work consistently for too long. It is nearly impossible to sustain eight hours of work without becomingexhausted by the end of the day. This work schedule also clashes withchildrens’ school schedules. Because everyone works for nearly the same hoursevery day, working people have much more difficulty in scheduling visits toplaces like the bank, the doctor’s office, the dentist’s office. One way to resolve these time conflicts is to regulate when certain types ofbusinesses are allowed to be open. This sounds ridiculous since people havealready baked into their heads this idea of “working hours” and because peopledon’t want to be told what to do by the government. I intuitively want to sayit’s a bad idea, but I’m a bit brain-blocked as to why. Another way to resolve this conflict is to put everyone on flex hours. Everybusiness is technically open 24/7. If you want to stop by, you can ping theowner or operator when you get there. This sounds attractive from a selfishconsumer’s view, but this model disrupts working flow. This model will alsoend up placing too many demands on people’s time. For operations that requirecoordinated effort, people will still set shifts so life balance is maintained. I am going to propose a less ridiculous working schedule that should preventend of workday fatigue. Shift 1: 9am - 12:30pmBreak: 12:30pm - 3pmShift 2: 3pm - 6:30pmTotal Working Hours: 7 Compare this with the current working schedule:Shift 1: 9am - 12pmBreak: 12pm - 1pmShift 2: 1pm - 5pmTotal Working Hours: 7 My schedule is more convenient for parents who need to pick up and drop offtheir kids at school. It also gives a nice, long break at midday for lunch ora nap or running errands. For those who would complain that I’m eating toofar into the evening, I’d say that you could restructure your life. Mostpeople eat and relax or work more in the evening. I never really enjoyeating dinner, so I would just not eat that meal. Rather, I’d eat a largerlunch and achieve the same daily caloric effect. There is evidence tosuggest that eating fewer meals is better for you because fasting promotessome kind of beneficial chemical processes. The evening is a time to relaxand unwind. Don’t try to cram too many things into a space where your bodywants to loosen and let go. If you find yourself running out of time toaccomplish your goals, either review and cull your list of things toaccomplish or become more productive during the day time. What do you think? I have a schedule like this on Tuesday and Thursdays thisterm. The long lunch period is extremely relaxing. In fact, today, I tooksome of the time to lay on some grass and watch the clouds. I don’t like reading email, but you can email me if you want to chat aboutthis. 今天的作品是一種詩。我失去了寫歌的興趣。反正我還沒發覺寫歌的訣竅，暫時集註著寫散文好了。 我曾經覺得自己寫文章的風格太死板，好像我從開始這個部落格到現在沒有進步。但這樣的想法應該不對。我認為寫字只是整理腦子裡的思想的方式。你如果想得通，你應該也能寫得通。所以我的問題在於我的國語技術還不夠流利。但我不會放棄，因為我知道我只要每天專心的練習就會達到我渴望的境界。 回家 回到老家探親卻更想逛小時候最愛的老店老闆早已退休關店但那店還站著，像回憶裡的里程碑我還記得我第一次來到這家店，我那天好像跟媽媽去逛街然後走丟了身邊的人都很陌生，我只想剁起來，等著媽媽用她那雙溫柔的手臂擁抱著我我那時還矮，所以只好匆忙的竄過各式各樣的腳腿去找容身之處。幸虧那天沒被人踢到。我走了好久才發現一個看氣來比較平易近人的門框我立即的躲進那個洞。外面的人好像都沒發覺到我這個小鬼我只好坐著，頭背靠著牆，等著天使來救我。沒多久我就聽到了一個人的聲音。那叔叔的聲音非常低、又非常溫和我那時想了，如果我終生留在這裡，聽著那叔叔說話，我會多高興。但那夢想不會在這一生實現，因為那位叔叔是這家店的老闆。老闆不許客人隨便躲在店的角落裡我突然被叔叔抱起，然後被放在玻璃櫃檯上。櫃檯裡放著一大堆莫名其妙的雜貨，我完全認不出來** "

    "body": "2018/01/31 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com In a previous post, I said that people who didn’t know what they wanted to do probably hadn’t seen enough of the world. This statement is naive in the sense that it entirely ignores exploration cost. When I was writing the piece, I was primarily focused on speaking to students in high school or even mature middle schoolers. For them, the exploration cost is negligible. Unless they’re already so good at something they eventually be paid for, they’re going to need to explore and work hard to make or find a place for yourself in society. My saying their exploration cost is negligible doesn’t mean they should explore willy-nilly. Exploration requires deep, focused effort to truly understand your aptitude for an area and your willingness to develop in that area. This is completely in contrast to the current paradigm of “sell your attention and energy to digital entertainment”. It is natural to want to escape and vegetate after a day of hard work, but it is wrong to believe that behavior is productive. The best strategy is to develop a system where you operate at a a near constant level of productivity. This man’s journey to 200 hours of productivity a month is a great example of the dedication I am talking about. In order to achieve excellence, you must able to put yourself into long-term flow states. Only in this flow state can you dive deep into a topic and achieve fluency. Fluency is commonly used only in respect to language, but it is a state of mastery that applies to every skill. Those who are fluent understand the inner mechanism of a tool well enough to manipulate it to fit their needs better. Those who are fluent in a language are less constrained by the structure and the vocabulary than a beginner. Those who are fluent in mathematics know how to manipulate the various building blocks to create new structures. Fluency is that state of being where you are in a symbiotic relationship with a tool. The tool shapes you and you shape the tool. You aren’t going to achieve this level of fluency when exploring, but you should be able to assess whether you want to or will be able to achieve this level of fluency when you’re exploring. Learn to be more self-reflective and understand what you want to contribute to the world. Dive deep into your purpose and work every day to achieve that purpose. "

    "title": "The Symptoms of Stress",
    "body": "2018/01/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Two days ago, I was so stressed that I forgot to bring my homework to class. I didn’t realize my near-fatal mistake until two minutes into the class, when I saw a classmate walking back from the pile where everybody’s completed assignments were stacked. I felt such shame and frustration in that moment. At that moment, I finally realized how stressed I had become. The week’s school assignments and work and research and club responsibilities had worn away my sanity. That morning, I was in such a bad mood that I couldn’t even respond when a friend tapped me on the shoulder and said “good morning”. On Friday, my stress was slightly relieved when a variety of bugs for my database implementation class were resolved and I knew we would be able to finish with a 24-hour extension on the assignment. That evening, I also went out with a friend to Dingle Berries Coffee and Tea in Rosemead for a much needed cup of tea. We also went out to get cream puffs from Beard Papa. I’m not much of a cream puffs fan, but the reviews from my classmates and close acquaintances have been so wonderful that I wanted to see for myself what the hype was all about. I was hoping the night out would have removed most of my stress, but I had trouble falling asleep last night because I was so anxious. I eventually had a good night’s sleep, but the morning was a bit haphazard. I ended up spilling some food at the cafeteria and was late to a meeting with a classmate. I really wanted to rent a car and go out today, but there were no slots available. Tomorrow looks pretty packed, as well, so I think I’m stuck on campus for the weekend. I’ve started practicing Russian cursive. I normally look at sites which have basic Russian phrases and try to write the words down while repeating their pronunciation. I’m not set on becoming fluent in Russian anytime soon, but I think it would be nice to be able to be conversational by June. I’m also going on a trip to France, Spain, and some other European country at the end of June, so I think I’ll add some Romance languages to my repertoire. The study of a language eventually becomes a study of the people who use it. We shape the words we use because we are constantly trying to find better ways to express ourselves. The language shapes us by restricting the ways in which we can express ideas. Major human accomplishments all developed through teamwork, so understanding how different cultures developed their communication methods can be informative in managing relationships. A friend showed me a couple episodes of Rick &amp; Morty two Fridays ago. I had seen some of the show in my dorm last year, but I never found it quite as amusing as some of my classmates. The show was no more entertaining this time around. I don’t think I’ll go back to watching television anytime soon. I raved about The Wire for some time, but now I’m tired of passing the time by watching the screen. The only show which I’m really committed to is RWBY, but the most recent season just ended. My view on electronic entertainment right now is that I’m not particularly interested in it. I don’t want to watch videos or play video games. I think it would be wonderful to be able to create content that others love, but I don’t want to fall into the trap of addiction that is built into so many pieces of work. ___我今天早上本來要跟同學一起去參觀 LA 的各個 donut 店，但是我昨天凌晨兩點才睡，所以今天就失去了那一個機會。我其實對甜甜圈沒什麼特別的興趣，我只是想出去閒晃。但我這個計畫的大問題不在於我的食物偏好。這個計劃的問題是我實在不想跟這個朋友花這麼多時間。 我跟很多朋友的關係其實很尷尬。我對一大堆人的感想並沒有特別好，我只是利用他們的聰明或車或精神幫我做成私人目標。這樣坦白地把我的計謀說出來好像有意點天真感，但我不太在意他人的反應。這個部落各地基本目標就是給我一個可以發表我的思想的平台。今天說的話跟銘的寫的信念是很正常的現象，因為我還有很多疑問要解決。等到我完全了解世界為止，我會不停地改在我的想法、我的信念，因為這是成長的必須地步。 回到正題，我對很多人的感情很淡薄，但那些人並不明白我真正的想法。但這也是正常人際關係中遇見的情況。人類因為冊心術的能力所以造出言語。我應該多跟這些傢伙聯絡，直接說出『我不想跟你出去玩』類似的幾句話。但我又有一種莫名其妙的想法，我不怎麼珍貴這些朋友，所以幹嘛要說那麼多話？我不如就用比較隨便委婉的方式去意味著我的心情？他們想跟我約飯，我就等到最後一分鐘再回答。他們想跟我合作，我也照樣不理他們，等著他們逼我回答在管他們無聊、完全不關我的是。但這樣做下去會讓我的人脈縮小，也會破壞我的名聲。我還是當個堂堂正正的乖孩子比較好，這樣省下大家的精神。 好的人很難找。我不想跟隨波逐流當一個正常的賊。我想超越社會的模型，造出新未來。 "

    "title": "Novelty and Quality",
    "body": "2018/01/25 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Too often, in the race to get into a good college, I hear that students should be loading their plates with extracurriculars. They say things like “you need ¼ extracurriculars, ½ good grades, ¼ miscellaneous qualities to stand out on a application”, as though applying to college is like meal planning. This advice is for the average or mediocre. The excellent know that skill trumps passion. The excellent know that they will be successful if they can rise above the crowd in ability. So, don’t ever substitute novelty for quality. Jumping around will only take you so far, especially if you’re not being purposeful. There are two stages in this journey to achieving success. One is where you don’t know what you want to be successful in and you are searching for that thing or those several things which excite you. The other is where you have an objective and stepping stones to those objective which you need to follow. Most people should be in that searching phase but are either floating around （飄）aimlessly or have given up on their search because they ran out of time or money. The rest are the people we look up to because they are driven, focused, and successful. You can see it in their eyes and their every action. They breathe and live purposeful action. Even when they are set back, they are so viscerally moved to continue fighting that they still radiate awesomeness. For those that are still searching, truly apply yourself to an activity you want to evaluate. It will take at minimum six months to get decently good at anything, and this assumes regular practice. If you are inconsistent or aren’t practicing at least three to four times a week, you need to extend your evaluation period. To be safe, you should work through at least a year of sustained effort to determine whether you should continue. Whether you should continue depends both on your ability and on your attitude towards that activity. People can only judge you on your actions. Whether you like the activity is your problem only. I am assuming these activities are mostly done to acquire skills you’d like to make a living with. If you’re good, people will hire you. It’s just that simple. (Good means good technically and being a good person. ) If you think this view of the world is cruel, how would you evaluate people if you were a hiring manager? Your objective is to hire people who will produce more than they cost the company. Who are those people? The ones who are skilled in their domain and are skilled in creating useful products with their teammates. Novelty can help get someone’s eye, but don’t put some non sequitur like “expert basket weaver” if you’re applying to manufacture computer mice. You must demonstrate novelty within the skill set the employer is looking for or could potentially be looking for. "

    "title": "Some Thoughts from Yesterday & Today",
    "body": "2018/01/19 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Here’s some thoughts I’ve had over the past two days:    Don’t bother coming if you’re not going to pay attention.      This came up during my game theory class yesterday afternoon. One of my classmates was sitting in the same row as me, a few seats to my left. She wasn’t paying the slightest attention to the class. Rather, she was busy typing an essay of an email to some professor. I think she only came to class because she needed to turn in her homework. But why did she stay when she knew she was going to waste the class time?   I now avoid using my phone during class time. If I’m very tired, I may slip up and check my phone as a way to stay awake. But otherwise, I focus as much of my attention as possible on the lecture and taking notes. This has tremendously helped my retention of the material and has made completing problem sets much easier.    I only take notes on paper. Taking note electronically is harder, especially when the professor uses formulas and diagrams, and it’s more a transcription of lecture than my digested version of the content.    My motivation to pay attention in class has nothing to do with the money. It’s all about my interest in building my attention span and my interest in learning the material. Reading manga in class, texting on Messenger, doing other sets, writing emails; all of these activities are either not important or a sign of bad time management. You know exactly what you need to get done within a week and you should be more than capable of planning out your time to complete those tasks.    So, don’t bother coming if you’re not going to pay attention. If you’re bored, either leave or entertain yourself with something other than your phone or computer. I’d rather have you daydreaming or doodling than scrolling Facebook for 1000th time, looking for a funny video a friend got tagged in.     My handwriting is inconsistent and should be cursive instead of print.      Argue what you want about the virtues of the digital age and the obsolescence of handwriting. I believe handwriting is a better linkage from input to memory and will continue to improve mine until it is completely legible, consistent, and beautiful to look at.    I’ve started using cursive to take notes in my classes. By the end of term, my handwriting should be much closer to something I can be proud of.     I want an aromatherapy set.      This thought occurred to me today when I returned to my room from the bathroom. My yoga mat was half-folded in the middle of the room and my humidifier was comfortably sitting on my chest of drawers. My mind suddenly jumped to images of wood-paneled, wood-floored yoga rooms with warm, dim lighting and aromatic steam. I wanted to be transported away from my current situation into that beautiful, relaxing world. And now I want an aromatherapy set and a diffuser. My current humidifier doesn’t support oil diffusion.     I used to hate commenting code but now it’s like an addiction.      I used to hate writing code because I had never written anything substantial, I was a selfish jerkface, and I didn’t do it while writing the code.    Now, I comment everything. I love having comments because vim colors them pretty, breaking up the actual code, and because it saves me a modicum of mental effort in having to decipher my code on a reread.    Comment your code because it makes everybody’s life easier!   我最近一直覺得我的中文程度在退步。尤其在說的方面，我現在經常會發出錯的發音，看起來真的像外國人。所以我今天開始修練，讀了一篇短的演講。我本來想找一些比較著名的中文演講來念，但我最終只找到一大堆被翻成中文的英文演講。大部分是美國總統的發言。我還是著找毛澤東等類似人的演講但只找到人家述說他的一次演講的文章。難道中國歷史這麼長、國力這麼大的國家沒有創作值得稱為著名的演講？ 我有可能在錯的地方找。但是我不相信我著麼名白的查詢會被 Google 看錯：「著名中國演講」。我最後找出了這一個網站，讀了第一篇文章。其他文章我明天再去練好了。 我不只是說力退步、寫字的方面也退了好幾步。現在因為習慣用電腦打字所以忘了怎麼寫很多基本的字。英文在這一方面比中文方便多了。英文字很容易就能照語音拼出來。但你如果不知道你要哪一個中文字，你很難隨便把他拼出來。有人認為中國孩子在制式考試表現得那麼優秀的一個因素是因為我們的語言比較注重熟記。但是我們並不能只像電腦一樣，鍛鍊記憶力。我們也要鍛鍊創意力，我們要去想未來、去創出新未來。現在，中國表現得很好，大陸的公司已經開疆很多新的做生意的方式，尤其在軟體方面。Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent 等公司都很創意，美國公司也在模仿他們的幾個 feature (不知這該怎麼用中文寫，有人能幫我改嗎？謝謝）。 我最近開始對煮飯跟焗烤更有興趣。我上個週末跟朋友試著做 brioche 跟 custard. Custard 的味道不錯，但麵包做得有點失望。我次日試了兩個不同的普通麵包食譜，也是失敗。但沒關係，我下次在試試看不同的作法，不同的材料，看我在哪裡做錯。 我明天要做日本式的炸丸子。如果好吃我在跟大家分享照片、訣竅。如果做的不好吃，我們假裝沒有發生這件事繼續過日子好了。 "

    "body": "2018/01/15 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I’ve been thinking about house designs again recently. I’m a big fan of comfortable houses. I want a place that feels nice to go home to and has lots of nooks and crannies I can safely nestle myself into. Warm lighting would be nice against wood floor of similar color. Carpet sounds nice, but wood floors with well-placed rugs can do the trick. I want a well-lit workspace somewhere that’s a bit hidden from the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. The bedroom should be large enough for a bed up against a wall or corner and a futon. The bathroom should be spacious and well-heated. Bright lights in the bathroom would be nice. In fact, having a variety of lights I can toggle, from warm to bright, would be ideal. There should be a small shelf in the corner for towels and things. The living room I’m not decided on. Most living rooms now have that standard setup which centers around a TV. I’m think I’d like to forgo the TV to focus more on the social interactions people will have when together in the living room. A patio would be nice, so I can sunbathe or just enjoy the outside world. An open kitchen is ok, but I want it mostly closed. The kitchen should be focused on food-making and cleanup, not a hang-out place. I would like to maintain a library. Perhaps I’ll have bookshelves embedded into the walls of my living room that are hidden with sliding panels. I don’t need a lot of space, but I do want enough so I can walk around when frustrated and entertain friends. There is a certain beauty to life which I’m trying to appreciate more and more each day. I don’t know exactly what kind of life I want to live or where I will go forward from here, but I hope I’ll be proud of it. I’ve probably said this many, many times on this blog, but I’ll repeat it because I want to reassure myself of some deep insecurity. Maybe one day I’ll move out into the countryside and regain my composure. Relax into my memories and fade away. "

    "body": "2018/01/12 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com There’s a guy at work who recently helped me think through the design of a web application. I have little experience with the broad field of software engineering, and know hardly anything about the web beyond the fact that I use too much of it every day, so his help was much appreciated. There’s two parts to my appreciation. One is for his being willing to help. Most people aren’t good enough to bother. They’re just too selfish or too afraid to step up and better their fellow man. The second part is for the effectiveness of his teaching. This coworker really knows what he’s talking about and knows how to teach. He introduces concepts in a way that makes sense, he checks for understanding, and he’s happy to answer questions. I had my doubts about him when I first met him, because he didn’t seem to have much to work to do. But he’s now proven himself as a worthy addition to the team, especially to the interns whom he’s helped. The best snowboard instructor I’ve had so far confided in me that he felt the ski school he was working at should focus on hiring good people. The snowboarding and skiing can be taught, but bad people skills are hard to correct in adults. Teachers need to be confident and firm. I see too many teachers on the slopes who are shy about correcting their students or leading them through “silly exercises”. I also see too many teachers on the slopes who take a cavalier attitude towards teaching and either leave their students to fend for themselves or ignore their concerns. I have a sense that teachers who are assigned to larger groups tend to shirk their responsibilities more than teachers with small groups because they think it’s too hard to keep track of a larger number of people. Those teachers basically just herd their students from point a to point b, without even a modicum of coaching or a sincere good job. The best teachers recognize their students’ limits, psychological and physical, and know when to press harder and when to let back. Teachers are major role models in our world, and it’s a shame when people take the job for the money and refuse to live up to their responsibilities. It’s also a shame that people don’t give feedback where feedback is deserved. Great work deserves more than a tip. It deserves to be shared with the company so that person can be recognized and promoted. Bad work deserves more than hushed complaints once you’re at home. It also deserves to be recognized so that person can undergo training or be fired. Companies have political roadblocks which may prevent them from recognizing good and bad.

    "body": "2018/01/08 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com My attitude towards my work goes through violent phases. I just got out of rather low period of feeling like I really should cut back on my time with the company. Most of my feelings of lowness come from the deep sense of boredom I feel towards my responsibilities. During my most recent summer internship, this feeling of boredom struck me hard because I was really only expected to refine, not create. There is rarely joy in debugging code, and the gratification I got from a successful run quickly fell to all-time lows. I find little joy in refining code to fix some minor detail. If, in the process of fixing my code, I find that there were serious design or performance flaws, I can get pretty excited about rewriting or rearranging the necessary parts. “The thought of having to expend my creative energy on things that make practical everyday life more refined, with a bleak capital gain as the goal, was unbearable to me. - Einstein My boredom can also stem out of a desire to just not be at work. Sometimes I just want to be at home, working on upgrading or acquiring some other skills which have caught my fancy. Sometimes I go back to an old desire of mine to be rich and financially independent so I could just do whatever I want all day long. As much as I enjoy escaping into that fantasy, I am pretty sure that kind of lifestyle would cause my mind to rot away. Then again, perhaps I’m imaging the wrong kind of lifestyle I would live in that situation. Perhaps I’d have a great house, one with a soundproof music studio, a tennis court, a nice grassy area and a view over some water and nature, access to a forest, an art studio, no television, a race track etc. I am clearly not up for the minimalist life. Maybe in that lifestyle, I would be motivated enough to occupy myself in the outside world that I wouldn’t fall to pieces in front of the computer screen. I desire psychological security and strength, but perhaps Alan Watts can enlighten me to the Wisdom of Insecurity. I just opened the pdf on my computer and plan to start reading it this week. I could use a harsh jolt in my life to make things line up better. I want to have fewer worries in life. As much as I want to claim that I buck the desire for stability, I know understand how deeply I desire stability. I need to grow up and face my realities. I once came to the conclusion that I can only be acknowledged and recompensed by society if I produce. I have to be part of the creative process. And yet, my consumption of meaningful content is so low so far that I hardly have anything to create. My bad internet habits are also holding me back from being truly productive on things I want to be productive on. I have much to fix, but I’m not going to give up on the better life I’m trying to construct. There is too much beauty in the future for me to give on moving forward. Some of the things I am working to get better at now are:Modeling and Animation in MayaDrawingSongwriting I would like to put storytelling on that list, but I know that would be a blatant lie. I have grown tired of the software world and am now pursuing these activities because they’re fun distractions from my occupation. I think life as an artist would suck, so I’m going to maintain a primary occupation in software and pursue art on the side. It would be nice to become financially independent through either means. 工作應該像在玩兒 有些人這麼道但我做不到這麼輕易就滿足的姿勢我實在太ㄍㄧㄥ連每早跟同事的打招呼都讓我心慌的話說不出口但這該算是我個人的問題嗎到處街上都聽人抱怨工作有多麻煩那我們人類進步到這時代卻還沒解決這麼基本的問題現代年輕人毫不終於公司公司也不太想管員工經濟實況變得太差退休金推到個人身上健保變得太貴多覺員工自負好了半托每年逐漸漲價現在老婆老公國中學生都必出門上班工作是我們必負的責任要不然支撐生活費用資金從哪兒來錢又不是樹上長的培養著我們天生的人才就樣培養後院的花園每天要澆水、拔雜草、施肥等腦筋也要每天照顧每天動動腦筋讓你變得更輕靈不要放棄你一直以來的慾望縱有一天你能得到你勞累而得的償還 "

    "body": "2018/01/07 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com The writer’s job is to create a plot which is natural. Everything happens out of necessity, not out of the author’s whim. The author’s role is as Peter Beagle said in his quote which prefaces The Hobbit: “For in the end it is Middle-earth and its dwellers that we love, not Tolkien’s considerable gifts in showing it to us. I said once that the world he charts was there long before him, and I still believe it. ” The author’s role is to uncover a story that has always existed, for nothing is new under the sun. The idea of uncovering a story jives with Louis CK’s quote on boredom:  “I’m bored’ is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you’ve seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you’re alive is amazing, so you don’t get to say ‘I’m bored. ” The inside of your own mind is endless. It contains infinite versions of stories, just waiting for you to uncover them in that special way only you can do. Don’t worry about being creative. Creativity is just a muscle that you have to exercise to get better at. Think of it at going on an adventure through your mind. At first, you will strain to hear and see the subtle signs which hint at interesting paths through your consciousness. Eventually, you will learn to recognize how to get where you want creatively. Work on building good habits that will enhance your creativity and getting rid of those which are holding you back. 萬念俱灰 傷心的人別沈思過去光線總不會反回源點未來的不良是你能改變的搬家 半路出家 造出新的生活重啟 再次尋找真正的你傷心的人多看看外面的世界花木 天海 都召喚你 求你注意世上萬事如意萬事大吉充耳不聞你已習慣 萬念俱灰的感覺但是外面的世界有多精彩看慣頻幕網路 有可能覺得不夠刺激讓這痛苦的無聊調理你的神經去多多享受欣賞大自然覺悟了嗎？世上的痛苦再每個宗教都說明過但我不想給你傳教你要自己去明白你的價值觀名白世上有意義的東西不都在網路上去珍惜那些無法取代的經驗、那些人你身邊愛你的人、你每天愛做的是、你沒去過的地方、你沒說過的話別等死神來收拾你在在意你早就該在意的現實為了人家的快了而失去所有感情坐在旁邊看這他們那麼輕鬆的笑容就算足夠的償還每一個活動都一樣平凡 無胃但我不為自己而活著我的人生是從他人找出意義我已經失去所有哭笑火大的理由只要旁邊的朋友愛人家人夥伴幸福我就好了反正我哪直得人家的關心凡事歸塵我並不是例外這麼卑微的我像狗一樣跟這跟這但從未是重點常被無視得我早習慣這樣的對待生命還有什麼盼望真是諷刺我付出一切讓人家快樂 但從一開始就沒被注意付出一切只是瞞著我自己很明白我有神經對人家的是完全無興趣 縱是只會觀察著人家肯定嫌我無聊 但這樣我確定我走了他們也不會在意今天是我最後為大家這樣的付出我的精神下次再見 就在地獄的一層（樓） "

    "title": "Speaking Habits and Politeness",
    "body": "2018/01/04 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com What is people’s deal with fake niceness? People avoid being direct because they think it’s impolite but end up saying things that are even more obnoxious than the direct version. For example: There are a lot of dirty dishes in the sink. vs. Could you please do the dishes? I want to draw a distinction between this oblique version of speaking and being passive aggressive. Passive aggressiveness is a deliberate attempt to hurt someone. It’s also a stupid way to hurt someone, because it’s clear that you’re too cowardly to speak up directly about something that’s bothering you. This kind of sideways speaking that I’m referring to is a deliberate attempt to be nice. They don’t want to embarrass someone by directly pointing out some fault, so they try to imply that something should be done. But why bother? Embarrassment tends to be short-lived, especially if the other person is good-hearted. Also, implications don’t always translate well. Speak directly and with politeness. Examine your intentions when you speak, because those will always carry out into your actions. People are very sensitive to body language and tonal inflection. Avoid letting things fester. Face up to the inconveniences of life, because they’re not going to go away, and the more times you face them, the better you get at dealing with them. I much prefer someone having enough heart and tact to ask me to do something than to be oblique and volunteer me to do something or make some sideways comment that implies something should be done or directly order me to do something. Most direct orders I’ve received have been rude and demeaning, so unless I am badly veering off course, please be graceful and ask. I feel like the art and requirement of politeness has been lost in the US. People still hold open doors and do those superficial acts of kindness, but people seem so much more aggressive here than in Canada. People here don’t bother saying “sorry” if they bump into you, they don’t move out of your way when walking against you on the sidewalk (gah!!!!), they’re super sensitive about identity, they’re tense about politics, and just so much more reasonable. Also, Canadian cities seem so much safer than American cities. This paragraph quickly became a series of bash America sentences. There are certain parts of America that bother me, but I’m not convinced yet that I should give up American citizenship for Canadian or other citizenship. I just want people to be more reasonable and nice to be around. Parents are responsible not for raising good children, but for raising good adults. Kids know how to be kids. It’s the discipline to act decent even when you don’t want to and doing the hard job of fulfilling undesirable responsibilities that needs to be taught so society can be enjoyable for all those involved. 學會新語言 想跟世界各地溝通講個道理交換風俗 人類真有創意 籬笆旁坐著小貓咪 他跟著我環遊世界名叫阿中在我最寂寞時給我撫慰明天開始又要出發 這次工作目的還不清楚可能照張相 爬個山 寫歌稿 早就變成萬事通大自然雜誌 邀請招我到分部 說有案子想派我到波札那研究野生生物保育我沒時間聽人家的命令 我過我要的生活沒人能阻擋我的視野 我是我自己的人闖蕩江湖是我必須做的事世上每個人都有獨特的責任這就是我的 "

    "body": "2018/01/03 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com One of my high school friends once told our friend group that the last word of each sentence been statistically found to be the least important in constructing the sentence meaning. To test this idea, she proceeded to omit the last word from every sentence she spoke to us for the rest of the day. Being silly kids with no real commitment to rigorously testing this claim, we disputed this statistical mumbo jumbo every couple of sentences she spoke. I joined in on the madness, just to see what it felt like to cut myself off on every sentence. The experiment quickly stopped, and we soon went back to speaking like normal people. Because we’re talking about language, I’d like to remind everybody about the all important completely intuitive English order of adjectives. "

    "body": "2018/01/02 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Every person has a preferred way of speaking. We each have a preferred way of teaching, of walking, of explaining, of arguing, etc. Sometimes, our preferred way isn’t effective enough in getting our point across. The other person appears bored or confused or doesn’t react as you wish them to. We try a different tactic of communication, which frequently ends up being a variation on our preferred method. This variation is normally not enough, and communication remains at a standstill. I remember attending a youth leadership conference where this exact form of communication breakdown occurred. One girl had stood up and was seeking advice on some kind of personal leadership problem. One of the four mentors on the stage was trying to help the girl make a breakthrough by changing her mindset. No matter how this mentor tried, the girl refused to budge. That mentor quickly reached the limit of her patience and another mentor had to step in. The second mentor seemed to say the magic words, and we all cheered for the girl, who seemed to have just taken the first step forward. Not every person can jive with every other person. I’ve switched coaches many times for various sports. While each coach has gone over approximately the same set of concepts, I have understood those concepts better with some coaches. Just as beauty in the eye of the beholder, the quality of a gift is in the eye of the receiver. I bring up this topic because it relates to my goal of becoming more creative and flexible. The world can be so beautiful if you just allow yourself to see its different facets. Life can be brutal and push you around, testing your ability to control your emotions, but if you learn to be mindful of how you feel, you can easily ride through the rough times and regain footing. There is no need for anger just because you are too inflexible to go with the flow of things that day. Reserve anger for gross injustices. Reserve your spirits and your energy for those fights which are yours to fight. Don’t poison your body with evil emotions when you can spare yourself through better emotional control. My desire for greater creativity and flexibility comes partly as a result of my desire to truly believe that teaching is the ultimate responsibility. I want to be patient enough to guide my students through their challenges. I want to be creative enough to help them understand key concepts in new ways. I want to fulfill this great responsibility to cultivate a new mind so it can go on to create beautiful things for the world. 愛生氣 我的心好痛心跳咚咚咚加快跑啊跑啊 你永遠逃不了怒氣大把所有觀眾都嚇跑但是這感情的痕跡 是愈不了的傷 學會控制你的心情讓你口氣變得爽快旁人都不太害怕反而想更靠近快快樂樂地通話覺得好輕鬆新年決志就是保持這溫和的感覺 瑜珈跟靜心變成新的俗事床邊的鬧鐘以丟掉現在靠自然節律過生活踏出新人生 注重養性打倒惡魔 拜神 傳教歷史書的記載幾乎把他稱為彌賽亞 一天再一天 不斷的進步人生有多美 腦筋有多厲害多培養你的精神 超越世俗的誘惑 "

    "body": "2017/12/30 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com A friend recently asked me if an entertainment-based economy had long-term potential. I avoided answering the question, mainly because I felt considerations about human capacity for entertainment were more interesting. But I think we basically live in such an economy. Most people would rather not work in resource-based industries like mining and manufacturing, etc. , and prefer to work in service industries like tech, travel, and healthcare. All the service-based industries operate on a need to capture our attention for long, uninterrupted periods of time. Tech is largely advertising supported, which is just another way of saying that it is a race to keep us occupied on certain platforms for as long as possible. The subscription side of tech operates in basically the same way, because every platform needs you to find enough value in spending time on the tool to maintain the subscription. Travel companies want you to travel more and with more luxury. Healthcare wants you to subscribe to more drugs and more treatments for longer periods of time. Some of these concepts may be better spelled out in Phishing for Phools. I started thinking about this concept entertainment-based society again today, and did a quick google search to see if someone more intelligent had pondered this thought. One of the results brought me to a resource-based economy website. I still don’t understand this New Age reworking of society, but its promise to remove us from the currently dysfunctional system is beautifully tempting. I am sick of jerkfaces who think that ideas like this are too idyllic to be realized. Those are the people who prefer the current system because of the incentives they have to stay within it. Those are the people who fear change because their perspective is too short-term. Life is inherently hard. Life is inherently flawed. But surely there is a way to create a society that is more fulfilling for the participants. Cut the 9-5 idiocy, the advertising-based industries, the toxic and constant phishing, all the temptations of modern life that have removed us from the beauty around us. Change is an internal mechanism. We create emotions within ourselves and allow them to manifest in our daily interactions. Our pain and suffering is a result of our dissatisfaction with the inequities of the world. Anger can be righteous. But how can we become convinced that we are in the right? How can we identify which battles are ours to be fought? We do not have infinite powers. Meditation and yoga can help realign our thoughts and help us manage the daily ebbs and flows of our difficult lives. We should avoid temptation and avoid placing ourselves in environments which will cause us unpleasantness. Let us cultivate righteousness and cleanliness within ourselves, that we may one day cultivate goodness around ourselves. "

Your life purpose should be set during a time when you are mentally unstressed, so you can make a good decision for your future self. Even if you don’t know what you want, you can at least set boundaries around what you don’t want. Every person’s life has meaning and beauty. To compare your life to another’s is impossible because you cannot understand the nuances and details that make their life theirs. It is not a crime to be content, just as it is not a crime to be ambitious. But do not presume that one way is the ultimate way. Achieving greatness does not necessarily require ambition. It requires discipline, and perhaps ambition is that spark which makes discipline easier. I feel as though my mind is wandering aimlessly through fertile fields of thought. But I am unable to step into any of those fields. I am content in watching the fields develop independently of me, for now. "

They had such intuition about how to tackle each challenge they were presented with and how to negotiate all the surprises they were asked to incorporate halfway through their cooking time. It would be great to have that kind of expertise at some point in my life, but I hesitate about achieving it because I don’t know what I would want to get good at.

We were walking around Mont Tremblant village and saw a bunch of people going into the store selling the pastries, so we decided to satisfy our curiosity and get the basic cinnamon sugar + lemon coated one. It was a lot lighter than I expected, but the flavor was quite impressive. The lemon really tied everything together. I’d recommend a taste of the pastry if you get a chance to find one of the stores in Canada. I also had a taste of Smoke’s poutine. I’d had the basic poutine before, so I figured I’d try their double pork combo, with pulled pork and bacon in addition to the standard gravy and cheese curds. Something was lacking in the flavor with this dish, but all the ingredients were of reasonable quality. Perhaps I’ll need to hunt down another place for poutine that can satisfy my palette. My time in Quebec is giving me a slight frustration about not knowing French. I have yet to run into a circumstance where I need to know the language, but it seems like it would be fun to converse with people in their native languages. I tried learning Russian on Duolingo recently, but I quickly got tired of trying to keep up with the program. That’s a dumb excuse to stop learning, but I’ll focus on improving my Chinese for now. Lack of motivation is such a terrible excuse to stop doing anything. Motivation is fickle and your enemy. It is relatively easy to get motivated to do something once you’ve gotten some momentum and moved into a flow state. Once you’re there, you’re well ahead of those who decided they would rather sit on the couch and do nothing for the day. Some activities take more effort to get into a flow state, but the flow state is still waiting there for you. You just have to build up the habit of taking action rather than procrastinating. A habit really is just something with less activation energy than the alternative. It takes less activation energy for me to play video games and listen to music for an afternoon than read some papers on SLAM. But, eventually, I can tip the scales so that I’d prefer being productive for the day. The sooner I correct my psychology and preferences, the better off I will be. I truly believe that once I get over the fear of taking action and failing to achieve objectives on a personal project, I will accomplish great things. 一時好一時壞 脾氣大的好恐怖控制心情掌握健康多吃水果多運動 健康不只是身體的問題身心互相影響 有時高有時低我寫到現在已沒辭可繼續 "

I went to Park City over the Thanksgiving weekend, went to Aspen last week, and am now in Mont Tremblant in Quebec. The snow-covered terrain is strikingly beautiful, and I much prefer it to the dry, brown plant coverage that would otherwise be showing on the mountains, but I tend to be woefully underdressed. What I think is warm, coming from Southern California, is simply not enough to fight sub 32 F temperatures. I don’t think I’d be able to handle living in a place with cold winters. I say this because I think I would quickly tire of the hassle of needing to wear sufficient warm clothing when going outside. I think I would miss the dry asphalt of LA and the convenience of being able to drive around without thinking about how snow affects the road conditions. Yet, at the same time, I want to experience something new. I think it would be worth my while to live through an full-year cycle in a place has marked differences between the seasons. I want to test my mettle and use the location change to force a change in my behavior. I don’t think I necessarily want to make this change right after I graduate, but if it does end up that my first job puts me in such a place, I’ll be up for the challenge. I once had a strong desire to chase the winter by switching between the Northern and Southern hemispheres as the seasons changed. I still think it would be fun to maintain a dual residence across the hemispheres, but I’m not sure I still want to chase winter. I suppose I’ll make that decision when the time comes. 一個人要走的路 慌張的無法前進問東問西他人指教 浸濕主觀意見自省走向陌路 腦海裡的空想到此沒用世界真理只能由親自體驗來了解踏出自己的生活實現自己的夢未來還能變得多美妙 "

    "body": "2017/12/19 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com It is hard to make judgments about certain activities until you have been in the mix. When you have been in the mix, it may be hard to distance yourself from the culture of the mix and look objectively on your impact. I was speaking with a friend today and we happened upon the topic of consulting. He said that he had helped another friend prepare for an interview with BCG and he found it difficult to know the right answer. The case we discussed was one where your client runs a business selling a commodity. A big conglomerate has announced their plans to open a division that will compete in your business. Do you stay independent or try to become acquired by another conglomerate? The expected conclusion is that you should to be acquired so you can play on a level field with the new division. The logic is that the division could play you at a loss until you fold. So, by being acquired by a company with similar resources, you and the division can play fairly. I suppose that makes sense, but something seems wrong about this analysis. Then my friend said that if he were the owner of the independent business, and the projection was that he could be undercut on price for 20 years before folding, that he would just let himself be undercut. He wants to live a good life, and he doesn’t think on the infinite timescale of the conglomerate, so whatever. It’s great to have been able to run his business for 20 plus years. Then he brought up Nash equilibrium and the prisoner’s dilemma. My staying independent and the division not undercutting me is the cooperate-cooperate situation. My being bought out and the division undercutting me is the defect-defect situation. Any other situation is cooperate-defect. We all know that one person defecting gets them the biggest reward but that cooperation gives us both fairly good results. So why not just cooperate? Then my friend made this comment about how the ideal situation would just be to communicate. I had made a comment about how I thought consulting was useless earlier in the conversation, so he used this as a case where consultants aren’t useless. He said that the consultancy could have two teams working with the two companies in question and facilitate communication about how to strategically divide the target audience. In this game of high-stakes scheming and politics, consultants serve as mediators. Not a bad idea, but contradicts the norm of “how business is done”. There is so much politics and hidden scheming involved in business that it’s unimaginable that two business leaders would get together to speak frankly about how they’re planning to build their empires. It’s the same in global politics. The name of the game is to not get kicked out of the game, and letting others know what you’re thinking is an easy way to make sure your opponents’ next move will hit you hard, on your weakness. Some part of me really doesn’t like the way the game is played. Why so much deceit and politics? Why can’t we just speak openly to each other? Wouldn’t everything progress so much better if we were open about our intentions? The open-source world operates this way and research operates this way, and both worlds seem to be doing fine. Where am I missing the need for hidden plotting? Perhaps I’m just too naive. For those who are interested in getting more perspective on business strategy, I would recommend Stratechery (blog) and Exponent. fm (podcast). Ben Thompson is a former tech strategist and maintains both the blog and podcast with high-quality analysis of business events. I’ve looked to him several times for thoughts on what’s happening in our ever-advancing world and have yet to be disappointed. That’s all I have to say for today. Have a good week and enjoy the upcoming holidays. : I’m really indebted to my friend for being willing to share his far more intellectually spot-on perspective on various topics of interest. I’m not sure how I managed to convince him that I had perspective worth listening to, but I’m glad we keep in touch and that he’s still in the area. I frequently find myself thinking in muddled loops. One of my other friends likes saying that my mind really gets a lot of use (你腦還真夠用）。She’s not wrong, but I wish that I could have the clarity of thought to see as my friend today does. I want to be able to think strategically, so see through deceit, to understand the paths to success, to be able to get good at things. I suppose that since I don’t have the skills I want, I’ll just have to work a little harder to get where I want in life.

    "body": "2017/12/18 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com It is absolutely crucial to maintain good skeletal alignment. I believe we should all strive to control ourselves as much as possible, which includes controlling our bodily movements and reactions. Aside from diet, the other factor in maintaining good control of our bodies is alignment. If you are in good alignment, you will not have pain. You will be strong and able to go about daily life with ease. You will look and feel good. So how to begin diagnosing and fixing your alignment? Start with Pete Egoscue’s book, Pain Free and go through the exercises to start moving your hips, shoulders, knees, and other joints back into place. If you don’t know where to start, either read the entire book and then choose a section or start with the hips. Your hips are in the center of your body and control so much of your balance that it’s probably the most important to get right first. Fixing your hips may even fix knee, shoulder, neck, etc. problems. If you aren’t convinced that Pete’s worth listening to, he has a series of alignment videos on Sonima Fitness which you can follow along for a couple days to see if they help:Hip: http://www. sonima. com/fitness/hip-alignment/Shoulders: http://www. sonima. com/fitness/misaligned-shoulders/Head &amp; Neck: http://www. sonima. com/fitness/head-and-neck-alignment/General: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=3-89-dJGGFU I’ve used Pete’s techniques on and off to correct alignment, and they’ve tremendously helped in keeping away shoulder pain brought on by extended computer use, correcting vertically misaligned hips, and a whole host of other issues. But don’t think that you should rely on Pete to fix you up every time you have a problem. The best treatment is prevention, so if possible, try to fix up your general lifestyle habits so you won’t go back into misalignment. Buy a better chair or standing desk. Adjust your computer screen to be eye height. Exercise more. Buy a better pillow and mattress. Little tweaks will help you immensely in having better health and a better life. 愛坐著看電腦　一天八小時還算少駝著背瞇著眼　一天老了十幾歲年輕同事買了升降桌　他嫌他小清新壞習慣累積腰痠背痛 花錢推拿也沒用老婆勸他多運動　他懶得管回家躺在沙發前電視迷工作狂　老樣子過倒死 下星期體格檢查　醫師提出心臟問題說是常坐不動的導致的病徵手揮一揮不耐煩走出診間說沒其他問題就快步逃走 下周去看孫子　兒子說他腰彎的更嚴重走上梯扶著扶著喘不過氣孫子笑嘻嘻說爺爺呼吸像個飛機爺爺笑著笑著開始回想以前還跟得上小子　最近身體老了這麼多吃飯時抬不了頭看兒子新裝的吊扇開回時發現投靠離腦後有多遠發生車禍會甩的多遠 回家睡覺有多難受　枕頭床墊都硬的如石翻過來翻過去只好吵醒妻子閒著麻煩下樓睡著沙發 後天朋友約會打太極朋友發現身體沒有對準　推薦	幾個動作他笑著笑著說沒關係　老了就會出問題 過了幾年他肩膀縮的像顆求做事難捱看醫生調整誰也不想安排固執到老　痛苦到老　早知必改 "

    "title": "Parents and Drink More Water!",
    "body": "2017/12/17 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Most parents try to do well by their kids. There are certainly abusive parents who don’t care for their kids or actively want to undermine their children, but let’s focus on the ones that do care for now. Because parents have such deep love for their children, they tend to turn into extremely selfish, child-focused machines. Every conversation must refocus on their children and how the situation can best put their kids at an advantage. The moment you have a child is the moment you enter into a brutal, blood-free battle to make sure your kid climbs to the top of the societal ladder, whether they want to or are capable of doing so. The greatest teacher I had was one who recognized my limits and was proud of me for striving against those limits. He didn’t demand that I achieve at the same level as the top student in the class. He didn’t seem disappointed when I didn’t achieve some objective he set for that day. He didn’t make me feel left behind when my progress slowed. He also didn’t try to hold me back when I got ahead. He was happy that I had tried, and he praised me for performing as best I could that day. The way he treated me each day I showed up to class reminds me of John Wooden’s definition of success: “Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming. ” This is the most important quote for coaches, teachers, parents, everybody to internalize, because it is such a powerful way to guide those under your influence. Each person has limits. Each person wants to do well at the tasks they are presented with. If someone has given their all against a challenge, be proud for the good effort they showed. We all have different talents and abilities, so please recognize each person for what they can do. Parents so often ignore this beautiful aphorism. They shout at coaches for not playing their kid in matches. They berate and humiliate their children for failing to make some ranking. They yell at their children for getting poor grades in hard classes. They demoralize their children for trying but failing to achieve at a certain level. It’s natural to feel disappointed when we fail to achieve certain levels of excellence. But it’s only natural that we sometimes fail. Children should be encouraged to fail, because only by failing can we learn to be robust and correct our mistakes. Those who succeed are those who never stop getting up. Parents are often far too focused on comparing their kids against others. It’s easy to want to do so, because they feel the world is only growing more competitive and they see only a few, narrow paths to success. But parents forget that the world is not stupid and that hard, honest work is still rewarded. To get into a top school and to win top awards, you have to demonstrate excellence. You can only demonstrate excellence by being excellent. You get to be excellent by putting in an honest effort, day in and day out. It’s foolish to think otherwise and try to game the system. You will be remembered as “that parent” and your children will be forever scarred by your bad behavior. As a parent, you are responsible for raising good people. If you are dissatisfied with the people you see around you, reflect on who you are and the example you’re giving your children. Raise them to be better people, because we need more of those in this world. Note: Drink lots of water. You need water to keep your skin taut and smooth, and staying hydrated helps flush toxins out of your system. If remembering to drink water throughout the day is hard for you, try buying a larger water bottle and carrying it with you. Nalgene 1L or 2L bottles are handy, but maybe you prefer a hydration bladder. Regardless of how you drink, try to get 4L into your system each day. You will go to the bathroom more, but that take that as a healthy reminder to take breaks from the computer and sitting.

I was off work and school on MLK Jr. Day, but the assignments I had to complete and other other responsibilities I had to fulfill didn’t stop for the holiday. I’ve gotten somewhat better at following my schedule, because I’m now more on time for classes and meetups with friends. But I still fall very flat in terms of following a schedule for completing my work. I simply can’t gather up the motivation and to even start working. It’s quite a conundrum, because I would very much like to be free of the classwork and other things, but I just don’t feel like doing it. This is cognitive dissonance at its finest. Somehow I’ve convinced myself that procrastinating on my work and suffering the stress of having to complete my work under a tighter deadline later is of higher utility than just doing the stupid thing now. The only stupid thing in this story is me. So now I have to trick myself into believing that following my schedule will help me achieve my goals. I must twist that part of me which inherently resists my doing work, that part of me which resists the boredom and tedium of work into submission. I must hypnotize that part of me into following the “right’ path. Once the hypnosis is complete and permanent, the self-deception will be complete and can now be termed habit. I call this process self-deception because while I can cleverly claim that I know how good it is to be disciplined with a schedule, I don’t believe it enough to follow through. So, today is day one of the hypnosis. I have what seems like a ridiculous amount of work to complete in a ridiculously small amount of time, but that’s just that rebellious, backwards part of me controlling my mind. 獨木不成林 我今天其實沒什麼想跟大家分享，我只是對這部落格有責任感，所以至少每三天要寫一次文章。 我發現我在最艱難的時刻中會一直幻想著逃離現實。譬如說我現在因為覺得學習跟工作都很無聊、太費時間所以一直想快點得到財務自由，去過我要的生活。達到那目標以後，我再也不用上班，再也不用侍從人家的夢想。那是個多美麗的生活。但我得意志不夠強，所以我近期還是要慢慢的煎熬下去。 "

I’ve devoured Dune, 棋王、and 孩子王 over the past couple of days, and I’m just starting to fall in love with Sakimichi no Apollon. I’ve also become more picky with music I allow in my playlist. I don’t just want music that sounds good. I want music with romantic lyrics that move me and make me fall in love with the rhythm and melody. I want music that I will feel inspired to sing the lyrics to as I’m walking down the street, to spice up my daily experiences. I think I will get back into playing music, because I love the feelings it gives me. I want to master the instrument so I can freely express myself. I want to let my hands and fingers glide over keys, buttons, drums, etc. I think I will work on developing my storytelling abilities, because I love escaping into worlds of beautiful emotion and relationships. That’s what seems to get me so hard about Sakimichi no Apollon. Everything about the first few chapters is setting up a beautiful series of friendships. I already know the basic plot from Wikipedia, but I’m amazed at how the artwork and the text blend together to move the storyline along. I want to have that skill one day, to be able to create stories that unite people and show them how beautiful the world can be. Sakimichi no Apollon is also beautiful because it is the first time I’ve felt so deeply that high school and college will be the best years of my life. Forget what the characters will do after graduating. Forget what the future looks like. The present portion of their life that the author has chosen to reveal is beautiful, so let’s wholeheartedly throw ourselves into enjoying the beauty of the present. Never again will my life be so free. Never again will I be able to goof off with friends and go on the roof and bask in the rain and show off at school concerts and just be young. Though let’s not forget that the Japanese school system is time-consuming and goes 240 days each year, April through March. I’m feeling pretty jazzed about life and this world of manga and otherworldly stories after traveling to Aspen for the past week, but I know my life going forward won’t be quite at glitzy and rosy as that in Sakimichi no Apollon. I can only hope to make the best of the life I have, and share the beauty of what I experience through my art. "

    "title": "Winter Break",
    "body": "2017/12/10 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com After ten weeks of term, I am finally on winter break. This break, I decided to escape to the barren highlands of Aspen Snowmass for some snowboarding. I booked a huge, furnished condo part of the Lichenhearth complex, which is right next to Snowmass Base Camp. I was very disappointed that there wasn’t much snow and that only a select few runs were open today. As a beginner who’s looking for some harder greens and easy blues to practice on, I was disappointed by today’s selection. I started out by stumbling my way down a couple of blues. Those runs kicked me around pretty hard, especially since the packed powder was real hard, so I scooched over to the only beginner run on the mountain: Meadows. This was easier than I was expecting, and it was short, but I didn’t have any room to complain. I got into a rhythm on this slope and headed home around 3:30, when the lifts closed. Tomorrow, I’ll be starting day one of a four-day group lesson series, so hopefully I’ll get good enough at the greens to start tackling some blues. I’ve got to work on overcoming my fear of toe-side turns and improve my control on heel-side turns. I tend to slough my turns, which is great for slowing down but is not great in terms of where I want to be. I want to also work some tricks into tomorrow’s routine. I hope tomorrow’s class will be neither mixed nor large, because I really want to advance to the next level. I brought Frank Herbert’s Dune with me. That book is captivating. I can understand why it’s called Science Fiction’s Supreme Masterpiece. I like it even better than Asimov’s I, Robot essay series. I almost stopped reading Dune after the dinner in the first book because I felt it was too fantastical. I didn’t want to read to escape from my life. I wanted to read so that I could better face my life. I finally realized just a couple weeks ago how wholly underprepared and unqualified I am for most technical roles I desire to fill. I also felt like most technical roles industry needs to be filled were trivial. Most jobs are not going to be as hard as Caltech problem sets, but I’ve trained myself to love and desire the Caltech problem set challenge. Because of my feelings of incompetence and boredom with the way life is, I’ve started to think more seriously about pursuing research and going to grad school. But this raises the question of what do I want to do? The best answer I can give is: something not boring. I used to think research was so boring and so slow, because some papers I’d scanned through didn’t seem to demonstrate any results that were worth acting upon. Then I thought about how major technological breakthroughs rely on research, especially from government and academic research labs. Those are the places with the authority and money and perspective to take on world-changing projects, like building atomic bombs and LIGO. Even though I don’t understand what’s so great about LIGO and have no love for physics or astronomy or space related things, I can understand that something remarkable has happened there. But back to the question of what I want to do, how I want to go forward. Right now, the one thing I consistently enjoy doing is writing this blog. I enjoy writing for the sake of writing. Everything I do for the sake of achieving some finite goal. Once that goal is achieved, I move onto the next thing, and the next, and the next. But writing is something I feel I want to keep doing, just because it’s fun. I want my research and my work to be like that, but I haven’t found anything quite that engaging. People can fantasize about how easy it must be to get a job as a CS major from Caltech, but that’s only because there’s so much hype in software right now. Silicon Valley is getting way too hot. I don’t want to live there because prices are sky high, everybody is high on startups, and because there’s all this dumb madness about sexual harassment and diversity and inclusion. I also don’t think work as a software engineer or data scientist is going to be that interesting. Writing code is now just something I do because I have to. I don’t enjoy it, and I rarely write scripts for fun. So, again, what do I want to do? Ah, I have no idea. Moving to a place like Moab, Utah, where I’m away from the extreme liberalism of the West Coast and can spend every day outside sounds quite attractive. It might be fun to jump off the high-tech ship and go live a simple life among the rocks. Then again, I already feel guilty, like I’ve wasted my time and my intellect, for even considering doing something like that. I think I fundamentally want to be acknowledged for something wonderful that made people’s lives better. The world is full of enough suffering. Let’s work together to make each day more enjoyable for everybody else. Chat with me! Ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com. "

    "title": "Colaboratory and Straddling Midnight",
    "body": "2017/12/08 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I don’t normally code in Jupyter notebooks because I prefer the flow of coding directly in vim, in my terminal. But, if I’m going to share that code with other people for a school assignment, I tend to use Jupyter for compatibility and ease of reading. I used Jupyter this term a lot for collaborative assignments and eventually wanted a Google Docs like coding environment for Jupyter. A quick search revealed that Google had created exactly that tool. This tool functions just like Jupyter with Python 2, and you can integrate with Google Drive to load in datasets for analysis. My only hope is that Python 3+ support gets released soon. There have been several times over the lifetime of this blog where I’ve started a post on x day and then finished it on x + 1 day. This is more out of accident than out of my needing that extra time to gather my thoughts. What will typically happen is that I’ll find inspiration for a topic halfway through the day, start a doc so I won’t forget about it later, then work on other things for the rest of the day. By the time I get back to the unclosed Google Doc tab, midnight has already struck and the carriage has turned back into a pumpkin. This problem is pervasive and you probably recognize it as bad time management and lack of discipline. Most of my friends who’ve seen my schedule know that I’m “busy”. I’ve got red boxes labeled with things like “CS 121”, “Pick up package”, “Go to work”, covering the working hours of most days. Because I seem so busy, they all think it near impossible that I have time to accomplish most of my weekly objectives and fulfill my responsibilities to various campus groups. The truth is, I don’t fulfill most of my objectives. I let lots of things slide, like going to class, and meeting deadlines, and checking in with speakers for events I’m leading and working on homework at certain times. I’ve got so little discipline that my schedule is almost more of a reminder sheet. Each event is just a reminder that I should be doing x at y time. Only a select few events are non-negotiable in my participation and commitment. I’ve known about my discipline problem for a long time, and I know long-term commitment is a huge determinant of success. I’m determined to change, because I know just how much could get done if I actually stuck to a strict schedule. At the same time, I wonder about what I actually want to achieve in life. I don’t know which path I want to go down. I have things laid out while I’m in school, but once I start thinking about my career, my mind’s eye wants to capture my entire future in one grand plan. It’s too much to handle, so I tend to shy away from thinking about what I’ll do after college. Grad school is a possibility, but taking the GRE, aka college SAT, sounds exhausting and stupid, and grad school seems limiting. The entire point of grad school is to get really good at one very specific thing. You’d better be sure you like that thing. I also don’t want to become that technically minded PhD who gets dragged into finance because that’s the only thing that pays well. I also don’t want to become the PhD who works on optimizing Google Docs latency rather than on something that’s relevant to my thesis and interests, though maybe I’ll later come to love optimization problems. Vaguely, I want to live a life that I’ll be proud of. But being proud of my life isn’t just a me problem. I also want the people around me to be proud of my life. I’m not very attached to a life of fame, but I think it would be nice to be acknowledged by a wider audience. Maybe I just want to actually be good at something. Then I would deserve wider recognition. And here I am again, back at the need to work hard and be disciplined, because without those ingredients, I will always be mediocre. Time to stand up and take responsibility for my life. I want to be great, so I have to make myself great. Here I go. Contact me at: ipacifics@gmail. com "

    "body": "2017/12/07 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Today, I started watching HBO’s “The Wire”. That show is really a piece of art. Even from the first episode I can feel myself falling in love with the story, the filmmaking, the dialogue, etc. Good television is really a beautiful mesh of the director’s vision, the writers’ imagination, and the actors’ ingenuity. I look forward to continuing the series. I also watched “The Usual Suspects” recently. That was quite the movie. It got boring at quite a few points in the middle, but the ending really jolted me. The entire story was fabricated using clues on the corkboard behind the detective. Remarkable storytelling, but it leaves me with a jumble of questions about what’s real to work through. I find myself daydreaming a lot. I tend to daydream either by reliving past events or by creating a mental sequence of how I want some future event to go. For example, today, during a lab meeting, I started daydreaming about what I’m going to do when I go to Aspen over winter break. I started thinking about how I’m going to pick up my lift tickets, get my rental equipment, go down the slope to the lift, etc. I didn’t even realize I was daydreaming until I suddenly snapped out of the fantasy to start paying attention. I don’t even know how I snapped out. These daydreams are like dreams. My consciousness flows so smoothly between reality and the dream that I don’t even notice the change in scenery until I get shaken out of my subconscious. I suppose you could call this maladaptive daydreaming because I do it so frequently. It’s become quite the distraction. But it doesn’t seem to be enough of a distraction to keep me off the internet at all hours of the day. Ok. Here’s today’s attempt at some rhyming. 快點給我戒菸不想戒就給我抽籤抽得好就給我上天上天看著星星 星球飛過再回來給我做個報告 外面的世界變得怎樣太空這最後的邊境長得多棒是否能跟外星人談星 小時候常夢離家出走得到自由後的美景有多猛但老了卻多想打坐坡一提出搬家換景身就開始顫抖你還能暸解我的心情嗎還是現在只剩我和你媽這些上代人 老了才能深刻體驗孤獨和寂寞年輕人的笑容多麽陌好朋友早就離世只剩我們幾個還在喘氣人聲最痛苦的一段就是你最落寞的那一段 "

    "title": "What do you do for fun?",
    "body": "2017/12/06 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I remember getting stumped by the simple “getting to know you” question “What do you do for fun?”. I hesitated to answer each time I was presented with this question because I felt like my hobbies were few and far between and embarrassing to admit to. I didn’t have anything commonplace or cool like playing music or playing a sport or making video games or woodworking that I could share. In fact, all I can offer right now is blog writing and reading Chinese fiction and reading academic papers. I’ve attempted a couple of times to get into Sketchup modeling and electronic music creation with Jeksola Buzz and even 3D modeling and animation with Maya. In each case, I’ve stopped at a very elementary level and refused to try harder to master the tool. I’ve done the same thing with a variety of Coursera courses. I need to build up better habits, starting with cutting my instinct to search for browser-based video games when I’m bored. Once that’s resolved, I’ll cut my second instinct to search YouTube for stupid videos to keep me entertained. After that, I’ll work on increasing my active attention span so I can at least work on a Pomodoro technique schedule. Once that’s done, I can finally devote myself to my work and create some great things I’ve been wanting to create for years. I have a slight disgust for the entertainment industry. I feel that each person should be able to self-entertain. Non-electronic toys, like Legos and kendama cup and balls, are acceptable. Books may qualify. I feel like books shouldn’t quality because they inherently guide you through a path of entertainment. But now, the entertainment industry has taken away most people’s ability to lose themselves in their imagination or in the building blocks around them. I find it so sad when parents put iPads or televisions on the back of their car headrests because they’re just training their children to become addicted to someone else’s conception of what’s cool in the world. Let kids be kids. Put them outside; buy them Legos; build a treehouse with them. Give them the tools to develop their minds and discover all the mysteries of this universe we exist in. There is so much yet to be discovered about the world; why hand things on a silver iPad to your children when they could figure things out for themselves? Create a little artificial hardship in your life by inducing boredom every so often. Boredom should motivate you to get off your butt and go do something new, not just browse the internet for the dopamine levers on YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook.  淺嘗輒止 我就是那種傢伙，做事很隨便，對什麼活動都起不了什麼勁，把生命看成很麻煩的一件事。有沒有讓你想起一個誰？有些可能認為我有憂鬱症。我不會否認他們的判斷，但我也不會承認這件事。我認為我現在的煩惱應該出於我對未來的迷亂。我還不知道我以後想做什麼，現在也不太想投入什麼活動。我就是太愛淺嘗輒止了。我覺得每次有新鮮的經驗比深入一件事更有趣。但我很明白大部分當萬事通的人沒辦法出人頭地。	我最終只是要過一個幸福的生活，出人頭地到底能不能讓我高興我還不明白。我有可能只是瞞著自己最深的願望，並沒有真的想要有名利的現實。誒，我到什麼時候才能想通。 我聽人家抱怨找不到工作的嘟囔以聽膩了。有些抱怨是因為 CS 專業的同學們早已決定好暑假要去哪一家公司做實習。另一部分的人就是他們對自記得興趣、自己上大學的目標不清楚。第三種的人就是因為技術不夠高，不管申請幾百家公司都拿不到面試邀請或過不了面試。你如果還是拿不到面試或通不了面試，你應該好好的去想你擁有的技術跟公司所要求的技術有沒有對齊。有可能你的技術夠但你看不出來是公司要的那種性格。技術不足應該很快就看得出來。你如果回答不了大部分的面試題目，你應該回家多練習再出場。你如果還是不知道以後想做什麼，你得現在開始探索。開始做成一些專案、去跟附近的實驗室做研究、去加入新的社團、學起新的樂器或新的運動。世界有這麼多的可能，你還在房間裡投訴著幹嘛？你要終身身為個魯瑟嗎？ 我最討厭那種敢一直說他們多想做某一件事他們在那方面沒有足夠的經驗。你沒有經驗的傢伙就應該去追蹤你的夢想，現在就開始試試看那一件事，探索你對那件事的興趣。你一開始不用花很多錢，只需要最基本的設備就好了。不知道從哪開始學？網路就在你面前，你還在發呆？！你如果想做就趕快去做。世界不會等你的。人家沒有無限的耐心，不想一直鼓勵一個沒有自動自發的意志。你下次就別跟我說你沒經驗，我只想聽你說你最近開始做什麼能前進你的目的的事。給我顯出一些動機，可以嗎？ "

    "body": "2017/12/05 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I don’t consider myself a particularly creative person. I prefer to think within the box because it saves me effort and time. Why bother trying hard to solve someone else’s problem when they can just tell me what to do? But this is a huge problem that has stunted my intellectual development, so I’m going to learn to be creative. Each day, I must force myself to endeavor something creative. One of those daily activities is practicing my Russian. I just started the Duolingo Russian program, and I’m hoping to maintain a good streak of daily practice sessions until I am at least conversational in Russian. I also try each day to write. Writing is an essential skill because communication is important in a world where our individual abilities are limited. There are also so many ways to express the same idea. Another activity I hope to make headway on soon is making video games. I’ve never been able to have a really good idea for a game that isn’t trivial, like rolling a ball around to collect tokens which add up to points. But starting trivial is important for progress, because only by starting can you get anywhere. I also have a problem with being extremely resistant to learning new programming languages. I love Python for its simplicity and fluidity, which makes me very hesitant to even bother reading code in statically typed languages like Java or C++/C. So, here I am, trying to fight the inertia of eternal mediocrity. I hope you, too, will join me in the fight against stagnation. We as creative, productive human beings can transcend the forces of entropy and achieve greater purpose in life. "

Our greatest asset is our mind. Our bodies can do whatever we set our minds to do. Fear is good. Fear is necessary. But don’t let fear hold you back. Be afraid, and do it anyway, because only when you are afraid can you be brave. It’s important to get a change of scenery every so often. Go on vacation to a new country. Move to a new location. Try a new experience. Deviate from your routine. The change will refresh your mind and help you see more clearly. There are things you can’t control, but you can certainly let go of everything. Let go of others expectations for you. Let go of your mental roadblocks. Let go of your anger and unhappiness. Let go and set yourself free into a state of greater happiness and health.

    "body": "2017/11/28 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I once said to my friend that a certain action was “too out of character” for me. Then I said that that statement only applies if I was acting. It’s now common for people to feel like they are acting. They don’t feel safe revealing who they “really are”. But how do you know who you really are? Are you sure you’re not behaving the way you are because of certain societal and social pressures? How do you know you are who you really are? If we want to think really hard about this, we could say that we are infinitely malleable beings because each choice we made along our lives up until this point was guided by feedback we got from others. If someone hadn’t said something at x point or if we hadn’t made y decision, our lives would be z degrees shifted from the current world line, to borrow a word from Steins;Gate. But that analysis doesn’t really matter. We are flexible, constantly changing beings. Our identity is fluid. Our memory holds us together between time points. As long as my memory is intact, I am who I am. Today, I also thought a bit about corporate competition and war. I believe I read something about people coming to war in LA over school districts and school effectiveness. I remembered someone else writing on Hackernews about how war is fundamentally a game of attrition. You have to continue as long as the other side is unwilling to give up. Sometimes I feel like that’s the purpose of business competition. Two companies attack the same space, hoping that eventually one of them will gain the upper hand and forever wipe the other out of the space. But that’s a stupid view of things, because what are you going to do once you win that war? You’re going to have to find another war to fight because that’s how you’ve defined your existence. This is my problem with setting goals. Working on a system of goals is like climbing a ladder. You constantly have to add new rungs to the ladder to keep yourself occupied. The thought of infinitely having to search for another rung to reach for sounds exhausting and futile. I think the alternative way of looking at life is to see it as an infinite game. Our entire purpose of playing this game is to continue the play indefinitely for all the participants. So, the purpose of a business is to survive as long as possible. We want to survive because we like surviving. We derive purpose and meaning just from surviving. If you are afraid, be afraid, but do things anyway.

I spent mine in the mountains of Park City, enjoying the little bit of preseason slush that was covering the bottom of the slopes. While I was there, I found my anger rising to unbearable levels. I would snap at the most ridiculous things, making life for my family and myself absolutely miserable. I’m inclined to resolve the problem by escaping, but I know that my lack of emotional control is poisoning myself. Every time I have an angry outburst or speak curtly or feel annoyed, I am poisoning myself and creating illness within my body. This is not natural, not healthy, and not good. Learning to control my emotions is part of my journey towards maturity. I want to stop being a child and take control of the wonderful life I have been given by God. I want to fulfill my purpose in life and be proud of who I have become. I do not want to be a slave to anyone or anything. The pain of having lived as a fool for most of my life is unbearable. I want to be free and to be able to make the world a better place. It’s time for me to learn to separate myself from my emotions and to see things as they are. Emotions arise for many reasons, and those reasons are to be understood and accepted. To move forward, I must stop looking to the past to guide my actions. Looking through the windshield is the best way to get to my goal. It is not natural to always be in a state of inner conflict. It is natural to be constantly medicating and treating symptoms of internal problems. It is not healthy to be fighting oneself. Internal harmony is the key to happiness and health. I cannot forget the importance of maintaining harmony and removing contradictions in my thinking. Write me at: ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com "

The hiring process is very muddy and imprecise because no one has a great way to determine a candidate’s effectiveness post-hire. Interviewing is as good as it gets to see how a client will perform, yet there are so many bad interviewers out there. There is no distinction between technical and non-technical interviews. The purpose of all interviews is the same and the format is quite similar. The purpose of an interview is for the interviewer and interviewee to determine if the opportunity is the right fit for each party. The format tends to be that the interviewer is asked to solve some kind of problem which should illuminate whether they have certain skills deemed necessary to perform well in the job. For management consulting firms, this problem is a case interview question. For software firms, this is the infamous technical interview, where a candidate is given some contrived problem that they are expected to derive an algorithmic solution to. Some software firms have now moved into giving more project-type assignments, take-home or in-person, which lean more closely towards a case study-style problem. From this process, it should be quite evident whether someone is suitable for the position. I think the process works reasonably well. However, I take fault with the take-home projects because I don’t get feedback on my work. At least in in-person or over-the-phone technical interviews I have an idea of how well I did. It’s frustrating to put in what you think is good effort on a take-home assignment and then not be able to understand why you weren’t selected to move forward. I say the process works reasonably well because I have no fights to pick with places where I got rejected. I could clearly see that my skills were not a good fit. The problem I have with the process is that some people are just bad interviewers. They don’t make their intentions clear to the interviewee, they aren’t good at carrying on conversation or guiding the flow of the problem-solving process, or they don’t know how to talk about their company and their role. Overall, the interviewer is a bad communicator. This is a huge problem because every employee is a representative of their company and every employee has a responsibility to recruit good talent. Every employee should be trained in how to interview because the interview experience leaves a huge impression on the candidate and plays some factor in helping you find the right talent to add to your team. I had a really great interview recently because the interviewer was very nice in understanding my objectives and preferences for an internship position and was very clear in his objectives for the interview. He was helpful during the problem-solving process and was clear on his role at the company and why he was working there. He was also clear in his intention to help me make the best decision for myself. I know everybody is trying to do a good job. Nobody wants to be bad at their job unless something is wrong. Sometimes, we need some help to be good at our jobs. So, if you can, provide the training to make the interview experience better for everybody. Another problem I have with the hiring process is that sometimes companies give you silent no’s. If the response is delayed by more than two weeks, I know I didn’t make it. But, just for the sake of closure, could you be bothered to send me that canned rejection letter? If you like my writings and want to chat, email me at ipacifics[at] gmail[dot] com "

    "body": "2017/11/20 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I’m currently in the process of arranging travel plans for my winter and spring breaks. As much as I don’t want to bother with finding other people to travel with, I know having a traveling companion will make my life better. There are some experiences that I know would be unfortunate to have alone. There are also experiences I can’t be bothered to go have on my own. I’ll come up with all kinds of excuses to not spend money or to not go out when it’s too late or to work on something “productive” or … just not go out. Part of my motivation for traveling is because other people have said these places look beautiful in these seasons. Another motivation is to see where I’d like to live in the future. The US has been good to me, but I think maintaining a residence abroad would be fun and mentally refreshing. Escapism used to be a motivation, but I am no longer as interested in escaping. I want to stand up to life, grab its collar, and make it do what I want. I’m an unreasonable fool, but I need to shock myself away from complacency. I experienced a moment of hopelessness recently because I felt like there was no career that really suited me. Being a college student is exceedingly nice because so many things are taken care for me and because I only need worry about my studies. I have so much time to sit back and listen to music, think about my future, watch movies, go out with friends, and have fun. But I can’t stay in this position forever because I need to give back to society. But I feel like there doesn’t exist a position I’d be happy to be in. But perhaps the more fundamental question is around the people I’ll be working with. I think any subject, any project, any experience, no matter how bland it may seem rationally, can be made the best experience because of the people you share it with. But there is also a baseline level of excitement we assign to each category of experiences based on past encounters which helps us filter. My filtering function is too strict on too small a pool of possibility. I hope that one day I will truly be happy and proud of myself and the life I’ve built. I want to be proud of the people around me as well, because a person’s worth can be judged by the happiness of the people around him. Going forward, I need to continue tempering myself and learning to control myself so that I can truly dedicate myself to the service of the world. Chat with me: ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com. "

    "body": "2017/11/17 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com If you have nothing to hide, you have no need for privacy. This statement is absolutely absurd. There is a difference between secrecy and privacy. Just because there is no secret about what I do when I go use a changing room in a department store doesn’t mean I want there to be no doors. Secrecy brings with it feelings of shame and fear because we know that the truth is harmful. But privacy is merely the concept of being unobserved. To know something private is not harmful. In fact, knowing something private can be insightful and bonding. Revealing private thoughts can be cathartic. Reference: http://www. jung-at-heart. com/jung_at_heart/private-vs-secret-what-is-t. html The need for digital privacy operates on the same principles.

    "title": "Things to Never Do",
    "body": "2017/11/16 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Never betray or double-cross or sell out other people. It’s easy to justify doing evil against other people because it’s so easy to think of examples where others have treated you with less than just behavior. But the act of betraying someone is probably so much worse than whatever they have done to you, and it certainly can’t be easy living with the weight of the betrayal. Fighting fire with fire is not the right way to behave. Some fights are not yours to fight. Turn the other cheek and let the other person come to a realization on their own. Separate yourself from them if you have to. A person who is broken can be healed by you, but if you realize you don’t have the ability to help, please entrust them to someone else and pray for them. Never ever betray someone who has been good to you. Never ever, ever do anything to defame or hurt or demonstrate any kind of ungratefulness towards them. It is rare to find people who will treat you right, so treasure them, please. I don’t want to compare us to animals, but I think sometimes about the ultimate loyalty that dogs demonstrate towards their masters. It’s absolutely heartbreaking for me to think about people’s dogs dying because of the dog’s unconditional love for its owner. Humans sometimes betray their dogs by leaving them behind in emergency situations, but the dog will never forget. The dog will never give up hope that it will see its owner one last time before it dies. The dog will never give up its love for its owner, no matter how many times it changes owners. I’m not saying you should be as a loyal dog to everyone who has treated you well, but I just want you to remember that some things in life are unmistakably beautiful and invaluable. Never lie. The weight of lies quickly builds up and it’s a disgusting habit to maintain. What is the worst that will happen if you tell the truth? It is better to remain silent than to fabricate a tale to messily cover your tracks. An honest man is a respectable man. Never threaten or insult or belittle others. The worth and meaning of your words is judged by the receiver. Try to be aware of other people’s feelings and exercise tact. There is no need to crush other people into powder because they believe in something different than you. Even if they are wrong, there is no need to demonstrate your “superiority” by dashing their thinking to bits. Be a decent human being and let others also develop into their potential. The human ego and mind are fragile. Never lose control of yourself. Don’t fall into addictions; don’t develop bad habits; don’t become a slave; don’t become absolutely independent of others. You are free being. Exercise your will. Never be unreliable. Unreliable people are absolutely disgusting. I am throwing dirt on myself with this statement, but I absolutely deserve it. Trust is the foundation of a good relationship, and unreliableness is just one of many manifestations of untrustworthiness. Those who are trustworthy have great control over themselves.

    "title": "Boredom",
    "body": "2017/11/14 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I get bored easily. This is a problem because this prevents me from getting good at anything. You can only achieve excellence and mastery by fighting through years of boredom and frustration and pain and backtracking. But why is excellence and mastery necessary? I am putting mastery as my goal to motivate myself to try harder. If I can get recognized for any single thing, I can loosen the reins a little and go enjoy myself either by pouring myself even more wholeheartedly into what I got really good at or go do something else more interesting. But boredom is a beautiful thing. I may have already written about this, but I think the point is worth repeating: boredom is the privilege of a free mind. I am a largely reactive person, so boredom stimulates me to go find something else to do. I want to be feel happy, productive, anything but bored, so I will do anything to relieve my mental fog. Games don’t help. Reading can help. Schoolwork can help. Going out with friends helps. Cooking helps. Exercise helps. The key challenge here is habit hacking. I want to make sure that I have something useful to turn to when I feel bored. Habits are one of our most powerful psychological tools for reengineering behavior. Change is hard, but if we can associate change with a pleasurable feeling, we can rewire our preferences and become more productive. If I can rewire my brain to associate boredom with being creative and getting healthy and hanging out with friends and getting better at life, then I will move closer to becoming the kind of person I want to be. Boredom is not necessarily is a bad thing. The worst part of boredom was how I used to use games and anime and manga to escape from reality and avoid my responsibilities. I still do avoid my responsibilities and let emails and other assignments pile up, but I’ve certainly gotten better at managing my emotional state and dealing with what I should be dealing with. I’m unreasonable and timid, but I will one day become that unreasonable person who tries to mold the world to her vision and ends up changing the world along the way.

    "body": "2017/11/10 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Lately, I’ve been dreading going to the office. I’m not sure why I’m so upset about having to go to the office, especially since I’ve really enjoyed the recent couple of days of work. I have too strong an attachment to sitting in my room and listening to music which I idly work on a Sketchup diagram or watch television or read books. I enjoy the comfort of being isolated too much, I fear. Remote work sounded vaguely interesting to me at some point, but I don’t think I could survive in a remote work environment. I think living at the office could be fun, but it goes against the entire work-life balance mentality. Yet, with the mega-campuses that Google and Facebook and Apple are building, living at the office may not end up being too bad. It certainly beats having to find distinct and suitable places to satisfy my hunger, need for exercise, need for a productive work environment, need for social interaction, etc. And yet I think it’s valuable to have somewhere to go home to that is separate from the hustle and bustle of the world. We each need our own space to reflect, relax, and recharge. I think I’m only now starting to appreciate college life. I’ve finally found a group of friends and work buddies that I genuinely enjoy hanging out with. I used to dream of escaping society because I didn’t have a group of people I enjoyed hanging out with. But now that I’m surrounded by good friends and reasonable living resources, I am less inclined to leave. I almost want to stay a college student forever and shirk my responsibilities to produce value for society. This kind of desire for irresponsibility makes me dread a future of being an adult. I don’t think I care about being respected professionally. I certainly want people to treat me with decency and respect, but I don’t think I need other people to validate my abilities. So I don’t really care if everyone else moves into management positions and takes on more responsibilities because I can be happy alone, studying in my room. I just need to occasionally go out to see my friends, go out to a new place, eat somewhere new, do something fun, and be radical. But otherwise, I can live a fairly simple lifestyle. Contentment is dangerous in the sense that people have less patience for bringing each other up to speed. You’re expected to be able to produce at a certain level from day one, not to learn on the job. Besides, who has the time to learn on the job? With time now regarded as such a precious yet not precious commodity, people are scrambling to maximize efficiency without burning out. It’s not precious in the sense that there are companies that don’t value their employees’ time and ask them to work ridiculous hours. Productivity falls off after a certain point, and only so many people can handle the stress. But those who can are superstars, I suppose. I’m not sure if this maddening, breakneck pace is good for society. I feel like Darwin and Thoreau and other great thinkers did not have such urgency. Perhaps Edison did. Perhaps Bell did. Perhaps I’m just being naive and should buckle up for an intense ride into the future. But I just want to sit back and enjoy life. I think there is more to life and brute force progress measured through output. There are too many intangible variables that cannot be bought or quantified but can be fully appreciated and felt. We must acknowledge the beauty of our environment, of human creativity, of human ingenuity, of the present. So let us all have a relaxing, reflective weekend.

    "title": "There Are Different Kinds of Hard",
    "body": "2017/11/09 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I once posted about how I think startups don’t solve hard enough problems. This statement wasn’t qualified very well. Hard is a relative issue, and it’s difficult to say what kind of hard I’m actually looking for. The hard of managing people is very much different from the hard of solving Caltech problem sets. The hard of finding a purpose in life is very different from the hard of getting rejected for job after job. The hard of academic research is very different from the hard of implementing a scalable machine learning algorithm for Facebook. I think my view of hard is narrowly focused on the kind of hard inherent to Caltech problem sets. I thrive on that now because I have to to survive. But there are so many other forms of hard that I have tried hard to avoid. I try to avoid hard people problems. I have so far tried to avoid hard research problems but am now starting for those kinds of problems. I don’t think it’s necessary for me to eventually become a manager. I don’t think moving up demands that you become a manager. I think it’s very much respectable to grow into an expert individual contributor role. Not everybody has managerial aptitude or interest, so there is no need to feel like you’re missing out or inadequate if you don’t ever become a manager. There are many ways to take on more responsibility other than being responsible for more people than yourself. I am currently seeking research-type hard problems to solve. Engineering problems and infrastructure problems don’t interest me. Analysis and model building and model testing and more analysis fascinate me. I like thinking about human systems and the stock market and machine learning and data science. Some subfields in these disciplines are human problems. Those subfields are trying to predict and model human behavior so we can ultimately create better human systems. Others are exploring the unknown areas of the field for the sake of gaining knowledge. I believe that research and exploration for the sake of exploration and research is absolutely necessary for progress. Someone must always be seeking out the unknown. I am also seeking to know myself. I spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of life I want to live. I wonder about what kind of house I want to build, where I want to live, what kind of people I want around myself, what kind of work schedule I want to maintain (or not maintain), what kind of work I want to be doing, and what kind of goal I want to aim for. It’s hard to plan for the future, but I want to know that I’m generally moving in the right direction. I think that’s the minimum I can hope for. I also hope that when the evidence demonstrates otherwise, I will be wise enough to pivot. The only problem with pivoting is pivoting too late. But, even then, I don’t think you can be too late to anything. As much as people have their prejudices, if you can prove them wrong, you will never be too late.

    "title": "Measuring Growth; Maturity",
    "body": "2017/11/08 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com Growth is goal we should all be striving for. We should seek each day to better ourselves and those around us for the glory of God. We are imperfect creatures, but that cannot stop us from reaching for higher ground. Even if there is no hope for us individually, there is always hope for someone else. We must move forward as a race towards greater understanding and good. A common measure of country-wide growth is GDP. I’m sure you could come up with analogous measures of growth for other human organizations. But why GDP and the economy must keep growing was a question that bothered me for some time. The measure is completely artificial and merely our way of coping with complexity. But it’s a reasonable measure that tries to capture value creation over time. I once read a blog post on the necessity of GDP growth and saw a comment that was quite insightful (sic): “Resources are not all that is involved in growth. The idea is more ‘how do we meet more and deeper human needs?’ That doesn’t always involve more resources. Many kvetch over how we aren’t making as much in our economy — we have more and more of an economy based on services. That’s as it should be. Meeting material needs is relatively easy, but making life meaningful, or at least fun, is more challenging, and more ingenuity gets thrown at it, and not more resources. The economy can grow on a resource-light basis if the services delivered make life more pleasant and productive. Largely, that has been the case. That doesn’t mean that GDP is the right measure for progress — most of the alternatives are worse, but my measure would be increase in net wealth plus consumption. That would avoid the fallacy of GDP growth showing progress as the economy rebuilds from Katrina, Tohoku, etc. , or the fallacy that our economy is growing when the government borrows money to stimulate the economy. Net wealth plus consumption does not grow from that. Finally, we need to adjust for externalities like pollution, lousy public schools, etc. Where a dollar spent does not yield a dollar of long-term value, the value should be discounted, the same was that China’s ghost cities should not be counted at all in GDP statistics (but they are counted at full cost). Growth is good, and generally, more growth is better if it is measured fairly. It means that society can do more to meet human needs. ” – David Merkel END QUOTEI apologize for the laziness of the large block comment, but I have not much to say on this topic. I just wanted to share with you something I found exciting. Maturity is a state of being where you know what needs to be done and you get it done appropriately. You don’t complain, you don’t whine, you don’t argue, and you don’t make excuses. You just roll up your sleeves and make sure everything is put in its place and is functioning as should. Mise en place. I thought of this while I was cooking today, because I felt like I didn’t have significant intuition on how prepare tasty foods. I don’t know how much sauce is appropriate; I’m not sure what sauces mix well; I am not great at ingredient preparation, and I don’t have feel for portion size. But these things come with practice, I’m sure. One can only hope to become great if one is willing to put in the effort to break down walls to achieve greatness. The journey to enlightenment is painful and horrendous, which is why only those who challenge themselves beyond what others are willing to challenge themselves with can achieve transcendence. I’m learning, bit by bit, to lose my childish behavior and predilections and see the world as a responsible adult. It is time for me to take the reins of my life and make great things happen. I choose to make things and allow things to happen. Luck rewards the prepared. 無聊是自由的腦的特免。我這幾天因為功課不多、工作的時間緊緊地限制在於比較空的時間，就覺得比較無聊。我平常無聊時都會看漫畫、讀書、或動畫，想辦法去解決那樣不良的感覺。但是我最近體認無聊對腦筋的引響有多美。我因為無聊才可以去深想著我的未來、動腦筋去發出我的創意性。我朋友們常說我想太多。我雖然有時候會想太多，但我認為我想多一點就有更多機會發現更精彩的理論。每一個經驗都讓我改造我的世界模型 (models of the world)。我們必須先造出合理、實證正確的 (empirically true) 理論才能真正的瞭解世界。 很多人覺得理論研究太難所以想去工業賺錢，活更輕鬆的日子。但理論家才是真正讓人類進步的領導人。我們如果沒有做長期地研究、去投資月亮射擊 (moon shot)，我們以後的生活就跟今天的差不多一樣。 人生的意義是從掙扎出來的。人生的意義也是從進步出來的。我們必須跟世界、無知戰鬥，才能獲得值得過下去的生活。讓我們一起戰鬥下去吧！ "

    "body": "2017/11/07 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I had nothing to write yesterday. I apologize for those who were waiting for my 1 - 2 day blog updates. I have problems getting work done individually. I have grown so accustomed to working on assignments with my classmates at set times that I can’t find the motivation to start working early, alone. This isn’t a terrible problem, but I do sometimes lament about my lack of individual ability. I fear that one day, I will fail to to demonstrate some basic knowledge or ability because I relied too much on others to provide those items. My teammates are all individual contributors. They each bring something worthwhile to the table. I don’t want to be that fool who is retained because they feel uncomfortable kicking me out. I don’t want to be the burden who asks questions which have obvious answers and slows down progress. I want to be seen as a peer, worthy of being onto a team. I want to stand out for something and to be rewarded for my contribution. This is the way the modern labor economy works. Each person is hired for their demonstrated abilities. Behavioral fit is also evaluated, because companies are now all on messianic missions to change the world and anybody who demonstrates less than overwhelming fervor for the plan to conquer the world is unsuited for employment. Potential is claimed to be evaluated, but how can you evaluate potential without looking at a person’s past abilities? So, really the hiring process is dependent on what you’ve already done. From there, some kind of heuristic is used to evaluate whether a person can grow. I think hiring is an unfortunate process for both parties. It’s stressful for everybody involved, and success rates tend to be fairly low. Also, most people you hire probably don’t care that much about your revolutionary mission to make the world a better place. They’re probably just happy to have a job and stability in their lives. They probably also need the income to survive and something to do other than play LoL all day long. But our system has largely worked so far. People are largely happy where they work (is this just me being naive) and good work is getting produced. One major problem I have with the way the work world is set up is the hours. Why do we work eight hours a day for five days a week? I think the two-day weekend should be abolished in favor of a one-day rest period. Two days encourages too much debauchery and accumulation of unsavory habits. The good Lord recommended a six-day work week for a reason, and I think he is right. If we are unable to maintain a six-day workweek, I propose we split the two rest days throughout the week. This way, people don’t have too much time to waste but can still feel rested, especially since the ends of the weeks typically experience low productivity. Maybe my view is just naive. But I think it’s worthwhile to experiment with a six-day or split workweek to see if people perform better and are happier. That’s all for today.

    "title": "You Cannot Believe; You can Only Prove",
    "body": "2017/11/04 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I believe I thought of this statement two days ago, when I was out eating with some friends. I’m not sure why this floated into my consciousness, but I remember feeling pretty shocked by the clarity of the statement. I’m not sure if this is true, so I’m going to go write my thoughts on its correctness below. You can certainly believe in something but then attach to it a responsibility of proving its truth. For example, you may believe you are a great chess player. But you may think that no one else understands this or perhaps you just want to confirm your suspicions. So you go out and participate in a variety of competitions which will display your ranking and prove your skill objectively. You could also believe in something which you have a non-rigorous proof because you haven’t ever seriously considered another point of view. This is probably true for a variety of people who have religious beliefs. Perhaps they grew up with this perspective and have considered it true enough to not be violated. Perhaps they like the ancillary benefits of belonging to a religious group and maintain the facade of faith for the sake of belonging. Perhaps they’re malicious and are using a religious group as an easy way to find unsuspecting victims. Most of your beliefs are just ones that you believe in because they’re supported by common interactions. Until a black swan event happens, you have no reason to believe otherwise. Besides, thinking too much about extreme events would probably destabilize you and reduce your productivity. But some of these “common sense” beliefs can be harmful. A common belief I am working hard on eradicating is the idea that initial encounters should be approached with a wary heart. The basis of relationships and connections and touch (defined as in Finite and Infinite Games) is vulnerability. Trust should be an assumption that can be broken, not a hidden reward that is to be slowly earned. I believe each person is trying to be good. We all have similar desires to be loved, to feel wanted, to make a contribution, to feel like our lives are purposeful, and to feel happy. Let us all reach out to each other with hearts of love and see how we can heal and touch each other in this infinite game. Beliefs of this non-rigorous but sufficiently true type aren’t ones that we really seek to prove. I don’t think they need proof for daily use, but I believe proving them can lead to fascinating insights. The process of proving them is also fun, because human nature is complex and changes with each insight. Once people know about something, they will change their behavior to acknowledge their learnings. They may not correct their behavior, but they will at least recognize various situations and comment on them according to some proof or research they read about. I think this category of beliefs should be known as beliefs that don’t need proof but should be proven. It’s dangerous to live with the wrong beliefs, so it’s good to understand which side of the line you lie on. Then there’s the last category of beliefs which you believe in arbitrarily. Someone told you something and somehow it seemed legitimate enough on first glance that you believe and repeat it to others. I think these ideas largely are sticky ideas, as defined in Made to Stick by Dan and Chip Heath. Most of these ideas are ridiculous, like the organ harvesting story Dan and Chip use to introduce their book with. But sometimes these unfounded beliefs really clog up mental machinery, like when people espouse their beliefs on global warming without understanding anything about the phenomenon. Or when people support racism and sexism and other nontolerant behaviors without questioning. Beliefs of this last type are odd and dangerous enough that I’d say they demand the most rigorous type of proof. These are the beliefs that people cling to the tightest, not for any logical reason (but who said humans are logical), but for emotional reasons. These beliefs have attached to a person’s identity, and to remove or dispel them is like attacking the very core of a person. But proof is designed to be insightful and enlightening, so let’s suffer the pain together and step into a new world of enlightenment. I think I would revise my statement to acknowledge that some beliefs do not need to be proven. But I would strongly encourage proof, not only because some beliefs are terribly wrong but because it’s fun and useful to prove things. You can believe, but you should also prove.

    "body": "2017/10/31 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Happy Halloween to all of you who read this post. Some think that idleness is the ultimate sin. Being idle certainly tends to lead to wandering thoughts and hands, but this can result in great good and creativity, not evil and destruction. I think being idle is an essential part of training your mind and learning to harness your gifts. Until you learn to sit still in a room, just with your thoughts, you will never be able to reach a plane of higher thought. You must learn to quiet your desire for distraction and immediate distraction and learn to wander through your consciousness. This is the kind of daydreaming that I think is most productive. It’s a very enjoyable kind of flow, and the thoughts that percolate while you’re in this state can be very useful for work when you’re more conscious. I don’t think I’ve ever really achieved this state, but I’ve heard enough about it from anecdotes of more successful people that I think it’s something to strive to achieve. The advent of digital technology has robbed so many of us of our appreciation for idleness and deep thought. We are not machines; we are not meant to be active all of our waking hours. Let us appreciate the moments of rest we can get between work to understand ourselves and our paths. By falling into a meditative state, we can slowly strip away the masks and walls that we have placed before the truth and finally be at peace with things as they actually are. Ignore the superficial calls of social media and the internet, because those will not fulfill you spiritually. Each of us was placed on this earth to achieve a purpose. Before you get sucked into the vortex of time wasting internet forums and self help seminars or books, reflect on your life so far and what you know. Try to seek the truth and proceed towards it. Your life and happiness are too precious to be wasted fulfilling someone else’s dream or purpose if it is in conflict with your own. I still haven’t discovered my purpose. I have had seen glimpses of areas that seem promising, and until I know the truth, I’m going to keep exploring. The more risk I take, the more likely I will be able to achieve success. The highs will be higher and the lows will be lower in this case, but the lows are bounded. There is always a way out. Even if there is no hope for me, there is always hope for someone else. As an infinite player, I must keep fighting so that others can continue playing. I’ve fallen into a snare now. I feel like I have run out of things to write about. But I think this is a natural part of the development cycle, so I will power through and continue producing on a consistent basis. Only by forcing myself to write will I get better. And so it is with everything. If you want to talk to me, send me an email at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com. "

    "body": "2017/10/29 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt The master is one who has failed more than the amateur. I frequently find myself diving too far into unimportant problems. I once spent half an hour talking with a friend about why a crossroads was the right way to describe a juncture in life. It was a fun conversation, and we landed on a sufficient answer, but I feel like the answer should have been obvious from the beginning. (We eventually came to the conclusion that the crossroads was really more like a fan, because you could walk anywhere on the 180 degreeplane that extends away from your current direction. But that idea is too complicated for general use, so the crossroads is sufficient. ) Picture here This flaw in my thinking has caused me significant stress because I end up wasting lots of time on simple problems. It is sometimes good to explore all the details of various problems, but it’s also important to see the big picture and think creatively about big problems. At the same time, I find that I frequently overlook details. I lack discipline when doing proofreading or similar activities, so I frequently turn in or present work with obvious mistakes in it. But these problems are just part of my journey in this infinite game of life. I play out of choice, and I play for the sake of continuing the play of others. Only by giving completely, by absolutely relinquishing control and ownership, can I fully participate and be healed. Life is made all the more meaningful by our struggles. For only by experiencing and truly understanding pain and sorrow can be appreciate happiness and love. I want to devote the rest of my life to achieving a meaningful project for mankind. I want to work on something majestic that will elevate our thinking. I do not aim to eliminate suffering or improve the human condition, because I believe that we can only be saved through faith, and faith alone. Altruism cannot save a man from evil, because if he outwardly displays good but his heart is corrupted with sin, he will still be sent to eternal punishment. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ and emulating Him and acting out God’s Word can we receive salvation. I want to work miracles by God’s power and help all of us grow closer to him. I am still waiting, still disciplining my mind, that I can receive God’s word and understand how I can serve His purpose. My vision is limited, but God’s is infinite. I hope to be able to receive my mission and carry it out faithfully, that the world may be saved. Amen.

    "title": "Path to Success and Motivation",
    "body": "2017/10/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I very recently posited that I would only acknowledge two paths to success:Master a field and become a highly sought after human assetAccumulate massive wealth and remove myself from society I was not implying that everybody should strive to follow these paths. These were goals that I thought would be worthwhile for myself. After thinking about my purpose more, I’ve realized how unhappy I am when I fight to achieve these purely selfish goals. I’ve come to believe more in Matthew 10:39: “He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. ” I think Matthew’s statement should be generalized, so that we can only find things that we completely surrender. For example, in Finite and Infinite Games, Carse notes a “paradox of infinite play: You can have what you have only by releasing it to others. The sounds of the words you speak may lie on your own lips, but if you do not relinquish them entirely to a listener they never become words, and you say nothing at all. ” (pg. 82). The concept of an infinite game that is played for the goal of continuing the game is very beautiful and calming. I’ve held onto this book for the sake of reaffirming my faith in the idea of the infinite game. I want to become an infinite player, but this requires that I slowly give up the masks and responsibilities that I have come to believe in as a finite player. It will be a slow, painful process, but I think it is all the more worthy for its struggle. This is not to say that every struggle is worthwhile. You can certainly struggle fruitlessly in the wrong direction. But if what you are struggling for is truly profound, then do not give up. Men frequently give up the fight too soon. They just do not know how close they are to the brink of discovery when they let go. I certainly hope my writings have become better over the couple of months I have been maintaining this blog. One day, I will need to port this writing onto my website, so that interested users can search my writings and so I can more easily run through my past thoughts. It is only by reviewing my history that I can regard it as past and understand my progress. I have seen this truth many times, but I still do not appreciate its truth: Motivation does not determine success. Motivation is a fleeting feeling. It comes and goes at the most inconvenient times. Anyone who relies on the flights of motivation that strike them throughout the day cannot achieve greatness. Motivation falls flat in effectiveness when compared with discipline and habit. To discipline your mind is like to sharpen a dull piece of metal. As useless as the raw metal is, so is your untrained mind. We must work hard on a daily basis to refine our abilities and our perspective on the world. Everyone takes for the limits of the world the limits of his own vision. Work hard to challenge your models of the world. Work hard to go forwards, backwards, sideways, and upside down in your thinking as many times as possible, for it is only in this thoroughness of thought that you can discover the truth. Go out and discover that refined, beautiful, silky truth. Let it touch you and heal you. Also read Finite and Infinite Games, because this is a book that will absolutely shake up your world view.

    "title": "People Make All the Difference",
    "body": "2017/10/25 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com What makes or breaks an experience is the quality of the people you share that experience with. Human connection is the most fundamental building block of our lives. We should cherish it more, because we are nothing without others. We need no identity, no sense of purpose, no sense of right and wrong were it not for others. You could argue that these desires are innate and that we are responsible to God, but then God is the other we need these things for. I used to absolutely loathe human interaction. I dreamt of becoming a hermit and never having to see others ever again. But now I realize how wonderful it can be to have friends you can engage in meaningful conversation with and share wonderful experiences with. I now realize how wonderful it is to belong. I understood that people, at a very fundamental level, want to belong a couple months ago. To have a good community can completely change your life situation and improve your health. To feel at ease and happy makes all the difference in life. In fact, I think it makes the only difference. The factor I believe we should all be striving to optimize for is the connection and experience factor. You should pursue activities solely based on what kind of experience you have. Forget the money. Forget your reputation. Forget your career advancement prospects. Just focus on having a good time, all the time. To give an example, consider a man who has a wife and several children and is considering switching jobs. He is currently working a high-paying career in a stressful company and hardly ever gets to see his kids. The other job he has is something he’s wanted to do for years but has suppressed. He will be taking a meaningful paycheck, but he will still be able to support his family. I say the right choice is to switch to the lower-paying job because it maximizes the experience effect. The man will feel more satisfied with his life and can, for once, feel proud of all aspects of his life. His children and wife will benefit from his improved demeanor. I think everyone in this family will become creative by virtue of the man of house taking the lead and demonstrating his belief in the importance of the experience. I think this belief should also be extended to research. Now, too much research is commercially focused. It deadens the experience of research, because commercial interests are short-term. Research is long-term. The whole point of research is that you set some smart people free in a huge field and give them enough tools and money to find something worth sharing. The Bell Labs and PARCs of decade ago are long gone, and even Microsoft Research has succumbed to the “needs of the consumers”. But consider this: the company wants to make what consumers what, and consumers want what the company says they want. Just because Apple makes a phone that doesn’t exactly meet a consumer’s expectations doesn’t mean they won’t buy the phone. They may look at Android, but even there the problem remains that you must choose among several styles defined by some product manager back at Samsung or LG. You can customize your phone within the brand’s limits. You live within a masked world where you and company both pretend you have free will. I hope that one day I will be able to do awesome research that isn’t strongly tainted by commercial interests. I don’t want to look so far ahead as the mathematicians who hope their work will be read in 100 years, but I don’t want to look so short term as to say there must be results within the next few months or within a year. I also think that people should contribute as soon as possible. Don’t take the high-paying job with the assumption that you will be able to quit when you have accumulated a comfortable amount of wealth. By that time, you will probably have accumulated so much other baggage that requires your high income that you can’t possible quit. Also, the prospect of taking a lower paying job or no job to do fun things may seem less green than maintaining your position. Inertia is a powerful force; don’t think you can fight it so easily. It’s reasonable to say that you will accumulate wealth and give it back to others who will use it for good, but I think your time is better spent directly doing that good. But each person has his own preferences, so my two cents will stay where they are. That’s it for today. Continue the conversation with me at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com. "

    "title": "Ignorance is Bliss",
    "body": "2017/10/24 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I think the reason people feel uncomfortable claiming ignorance is bliss is because uncertainty is painful. But whether uncertainty and ignorance are equivalent or similar enough to be compared in this way is another question. Ignorance is the state of not knowing. At which point do you cross over from being ignorant to being in a position where you know just enough to be uncertain and worried about a situation? To give an example, my friend and I were recently eating in a shopping mall where the emergency strobe lights were going off. The mall was also unusually warm, meaning the air conditioning was not functioning. But no one was in a state of alarm, so business went on as usual. At that point, we were ignorant of the true situation but aware enough of what these signals meant to be anxious. Neither of us were really worried, but I did feel a moment of nervousness due to uncertainty in what was really happening. Think of a generic situation where someone is ignorant of most of sequence of events that led to the circumstance but can see signs that suggest something bad happened. One classic reaction is for that person to become very nervous and rush around to bystanders, asking if they know anything about what’s happening. Another example is that he just don’t care and moves on with his life. I previously accepted the statement “ignorance is bliss” because those who don’t know just don’t know. Consider a woman sitting on a bench with her back facing a restaurant window. She’s on her phone, browsing the web. There is a man sitting at the table just on the other side of the window, watching her phone screen. To a bystander, this would probably trigger all kinds of warning signals about privacy. But the woman, who is ignorant of the man, is blissfully looking through her phone. The same is with children. Children are blissfully ignorant of “how the world works” and live blissfully in the bubble the adults around them have constructed just for their protection. To go back to circumstances which seem to break my logic, think of people who say “you’ll know when you’re older” or “I’ll tell you when you’re older”. The person on the receiving end is still ignorant, but he is not blissful. He is probably rather peeved to be deprived of information. But the reason he is upset is because he is aware that he is ignorant. He is also being given strong clues that whatever people were hiding from him is important. It must be important because he clearly doesn’t have the prerequisites to know the information. In this circumstance, you are no longer ignorant. You are ignorant of what other people know, but you now know that other people know something you don’t and that that something else is important. So I think this situation still follows my logic that not knowing what you don’t know is blissful. Let’s go back to the generic situation where someone desperately wants to know what happened but doesn’t. Again, the person who is upset is now aware of their ignorance of something that appears important. The person who isn’t upset is in the same situation as the person who is upset, but they have accepted their ignorance. To conclude, I think there are varying levels of being ignorantly blissful. One is where you just don’t know what you don’t know and you have nothing to worry about. Another is where you know you don’t know something but you are willing to accept your ignorance. The circumstances where people get upset are when someone or something pulls out something from their world of unknown unknowns (what they don’t know they don’t know) and proves to them that what they don’t know is somehow important. In that case, they can continue being upset and try to resolve their uncertainty or just accept it and move on to other problems.

    "title": "Good Food and Price Consciousness",
    "body": "2017/10/22 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt It’s hard to find good food in America. I think there are three contributing factors:Extreme price consciousnessExtreme preference for convenienceSeeing food as fuelLack of quality ingredients Americans are so, so, so price consciousness, it’s destroyed the market for high-quality goods. Whole Foods was renamed Whole Paycheck, and those who shopped there were assumed to be either extremely rich or crazy vegan hippies. Corn and other extremely subsidized crops sell for prices so cheap as to be unreasonable, and any other vegetables with prices more than $1 each or $1/pound are considered carefully before purchase. People here love also sales. There is a positive feedback loop hidden in this mechanism, where some genius discovered that discounts boosted his revenues and decided to use them more. Then people, being the “rational” beings they are, decided to move their dollars to discount-eager stores. Since selling things in grocery and convenience stores is very much a commodity business, everybody else in the industry jumped on the discount bandwagon to stay in the business. And now this behavior has been heavily ingrained into the psyches of the modern shoppers. The whole organic not organic argument was a big deal mostly because organic goods were more expensive. There were minimal arguments about organic food tasting better (I think it does), but mostly people were concerned about price. Nobody cared about whether the organic food was actually grown in better conditions, whether it was better for them, or whether it was better for environment. Everything revolved around price (partly concerned convenience, because organic was easier to find at specialty shops like Whole Foods). Now that Costco and most other major retail chains with a grocery department have added major organic offerings, no one even thinks twice about eating organic. Let’s talk about convenience. Most people I know would rather eat at the dingy sandwich shop 5 minutes from their office than drive 20 minutes to a restaurant they can actually enjoy their meal at. Most people also function under a sort of hyperbolic discounting model for distance to their current location. They prefer restaurants, shops, experiences, etc. , that are close, because we’ve be taught to value stability. Stay where you are and be grateful for what you have. Why would you go somewhere else with worse facilities when you could just enjoy the luxurious American lifestyle? There is a big argument in favor of mobility, which I think you should read about in Tyler Cowen’s [The Complacent Class](https://www. amazon. com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691). Mobility changes your brain by virtue of novelty. But back to food. I don’t have much more to say about convenience, so let me jump into my unifying argument: we see food as fuel, not as an experience. This is a view commonly heard among body builders and fitness enthusiasts. They love to talk about how eating kale and coconut milk and chicken for breakfast, lunch, and dinner gives your body the essential fuel it needs to function as a fat-burning machine. I won’t deny that eating vegetables and healthy fats and fiber is better for your health, but I don’t think we should completely abstract away the pleasure that eating gives us. This view has also resulted in people being more and more willing to shorten their meal times. Because food is just fuel, we should try to be as efficient in eating it as possible. Rather than eating solid foods which take time to digest and chew, we should all live off Soylent or nutritionally complete IVs. This way, we can work at max productivity, all day long, like machines. This is a dangerous view because humans are not machines. We are intelligent beings with emotions and physical wants and needs and desires for higher purposes. We should strive to escape the banality of the world and transcend to a higher spiritual plane. One way of regaining our sanity in this world of move fast and break things and work yourself to death so you can achieve 50% growth year over year ad infinitum is to take the time to appreciate our food. Food is such a delicate thing. It has to be carefully grown and harvested in the right conditions and nurtured along its delivery path our plates. We’ve completely abstracted away this process, and most people now probably think farming is very low class or dirty or unpresentable. Farming is hard work. It’s honest work that grounds and connects you with reality. Being in the garden, and working on the dramatic game (see Finite and Infinite Games) of gardening really opens up your mind to a whole new world of possibility. Release yourself from the chains of society and become an infinite player. For those who don’t understand my references, I recommend you read Finite and Infinite Games, by James P. Carse. This is an excellent book that details a model of the world that I think is more correct than others commonly propagated. It helped me come to be at peace with myself. To conclude this essay, let me just say that the above three factors of price consciousness, hyperbolic discounting on convenience, and the food as fuel ideology resulted in the incentives to not have quality ingredients. If food is just fuel, who cares about quality and tastiness? Just get those nutrients in so I can continue working. If I want cheap food, who cares how it’s made or the long-term effects? Convenient food is probably not going to be quality food. The big corporations have molded and guided our preferences in this direction. If you agree with my views, stop letting them push you around and start making a stand for a better quality of life. Start by eating good food. Contact me at ipacifics@gmail. com.

I don’t know when this peace will break, but I think my conclusions are rational and will lead me in the right direction. The next step is to emotionally acclimate myself to this new path. I have gone through many, many destructive phases, most of which were variations on the theme of wanting to become super rich and turn into a hermit. Those thoughts helped soothe my anger and frustration when I felt like life wasn’t going in a satisfactory direction, but I’ve come to terms with how I think I want to mold my future. Money is not my main objective. I used to think having a purpose in life would sustain me, but I now am willing to defer that goal of having a purpose in life for 10 years. I feel I am too young and too naive to be able to clearly formulate a purpose. I hope that in 10 years, I will have come up with my purpose. I hope that in 20 years, I will have made progress towards achieving that purpose. In the meantime, I want to solve hard problems, which most likely means pursuing a PhD. Why do I want to solve hard problems? As vibrant as the startup culture has proven, I don’t think startups solve hard enough problems. Amazon and Google have commoditized many hard engineering problems related to getting set up and running. This makes it exceedingly easy for some half capable engineers to pull together a web app or mobile app and market it as the next solution for X. There’s also a ridiculous amount of money floating around. It’s a self-reinforcing loop where aspiring entrepreneurs start some “easy” company that solves a niche problem and then investors fund these cash cows and then more aspiring entrepreneurs get lured to the money and so on. Creating a CRM dashboard for the dental industry just because no one else has done it will make you money, but it is neither hard nor interesting enough for me. Startups just don’t have enough resources to dedicate to solving hard problems. I will not deny that there are startups like Tesla, and SpaceX, and 3D printing companies that are solving fundamentally challenging issues. But I want to solve more basic problems. I want to do research that is just between basic research and applied research. I want to be at the current Bell Labs or Xerox PARC. I feel like my Caltech education would be a waste if I didn’t spend at least past of my life past undergrad working on fundamentally hard problems. I don’t know if I’ll fit into the research culture, but I think this is the right direction to be going. I will probably stop working at Virtualitics soon, so I can focus on researching something awesome. Contact me at ipacifics@gmail. com "

After I went off to the Grace Hopper conference and had to get more serious about completing my school work, I started to lose motivation and time for writing. But those, I feel are weak excuses that demonstrate my lack of commitment and direction. I hope to build back up my habit of writing every 1 - 2 days on this platform so I can refine my thoughts and discover my purpose. I have a problem with people being tardy. I believe everyone has the ability to be consistently punctual. But there are so few punishments associated with tardiness for people in my social and school circle that there is no motivation to change the bad habit of lateness. There is also the confounding factor that we have devices for continuous updating. Since we can instantaneously send off messages to our peers saying we will be late, we don’t have to worry about other people waiting hopelessly for us. Nothing is ever unknown, and nothing is set ever set in stone. Plans can change on the fly because we can instantly reorganize over the digital network. Calendars and meetings are merely suggestions. Running late is now the norm, not showing up to things is now the norm, and losing track of time is now the norm. The responsibility for enforcing tardiness is on my shoulders. Tolerating tardiness merely allows it to proliferate. Tolerating anything merely allows it to proliferate. Shifting away from tardiness onto tolerance, some things I do not believe should be tolerated are:Technology use in class or meetings (mostly)Eating in class or meetingsTardiness to class or meetings I add “to class” to all my instances because I’m still in school. Here’s my rationale behind each of the three items:Technology is distracting, and allowing its use reinforces technology addiction. Most students go on their phones or computers when they are bored to browse Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, etc. Multitasking in this way is dangerous. It is also a waste of time for a student to show up to class just to watch YouTube videos of cats jumping over fences for an hour. Taking notes on a computer is less effective than taking notes by hand. The speed and ease of digital note taking encourages transcription, rather than summary and re-interpretation of the material being presented. It also encourages students to look things up in the middle of note-taking and risk becoming distracted by the tangency of Googling things. Allowing students to use technology in class to relieve their boredom reinforces the neural pathways that lead to addiction. Humans should have coping mechanisms beyond the flashing screen. Allowing students to use technology to Google for things encourages the fragility of knowledge that Feynman decried. There are some things they should just know. If they don’t know them, they should write them down and look them up later. Whatever they don’t know is probably not so essential to the current material that they cannot keep up. If they can’t keep up, there is a problem here with their study habits or level of ability. Eating in class or meetingsAmericans have been trained to devalue quality of food and overweight cheapness and convenience. Eating is an experience that should be treasured and fully enjoyed with good company and ambience. People may be somewhat more relaxed and happy over a meal, but they are also more distracted. I find meetings without food to be far more productive than meetings with food, even just snacks or water. Eating in class is distracting and rude. There are set times for eating breaks throughout the day, and students should have enough respect for the class period to retrain themselves. Eating can also be messy. Regardless of how carefully you use your napkin and utensils, there are undoubtedly going to be crumbs, sauces, and other food items scattered about a room after a meal. Most people never clean up after eating for the next group. Avoid the need to clean up by not allowing food to begin with. TardinessI’ve already given some gripes about tardiness, but I think the main problem here is the signaling about lack of respect. Never tell me you lost track of time, because I know that’s a blatant excuse. You had the ability to stop a conversation or meeting short and you failed to meet your obligation to me. Some people like to use lateness as a signal of their power over others. That is extremely rude, no matter who you are. I want a mentor or supervisor to respect me as I respect them, so please don’t think you can get away with such ridiculous behavior and not be disliked. That’s it for today.

    "body": "2017/10/02 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. com I’ve been through many phases with music. At some point, I wanted to be like everybody else and started listening to music while I worked. I tried listening to classical, to instrumental, to jazz, and to pop music, but everything was super distracting. I then tried listening to music while I exercised. That also turned out to be extremely distracting, especially since I would time my movements to the beat of the music. During this time, I joined the Spotify crowd, because I am fully steeped in the world of free everything. I accumulated a large playlist of Chinese pop music and would use the Spotify daily discovery list to augment and filter my preferences. Then that got boring, because Spotify stopped recommending anything interesting. Every artist was the same, and I was tired of listening to the same people. At some point, I realized that I couldn’t use music in the background. I either had to focus on listening to the song, especially since I like singing along, or just not listen to music. It was hard to break the habit, especially since I had long since coaxed myself into a state of needing constant, high-energy stimulation, but it really paid off. My attention span is still very short, but I find it easier to concentrate now. Cutting the music habit and shutting down notifications on my phone and computer really helped me realized that most of the time, I don’t have anything to do when I open the computer. In fact, I now crave offline experiences and try to read everything in hard copy. Our brains are malleable, and the constant stimulation of the Internet combined with the pleasure we receive from the pop-ups and moving images of the digital world have trained us to constantly seek new experiences. And now most people are stimulus deprived fools, constantly checking their phones for any new messages or notifications or status posts, hoping to get that extra dopamine rush. This is dangerous, which is why I am slowly retreating from technology and trying to regain my sanity. I hope I will find happiness and truth in this approach.

    "body": "2017/09/30 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Two days ago, I uploaded some pictures of the Techcrunch brochure and some pictures of house designs I created during my internship. The house designs I hope to put on Sketchup, so I can work through the kinks and details of what I would like to see each day I wake up and come home. Within the house design photos is a sketch of a new kind of built-in light I think would be very sleek. This is the light I’m currently using: http://www. koncept. com/Z-Bar Here are some problems I have with lights. Most of these note apply to desk lamps: Lights that shine down from the ceiling onto your workspace can generate a lot of heat. It can be tricky to adjust the angle of the lamp to shine just how you want onto the desk surface. I sometimes move my head in just the wrong direction and end up looking directly at the light source. Glare and other unfocused light beams hurt my eyes and are distracting. They take up too much space. So, my idea was to create a bar of light that would be installed into the wall or solid vertical structure just behind your desk. There would be a recess into your wall that would have lights embedded into the upper surface. Below is a quick, sideways schematic that should explain what I mean. Photo here Now that the lights are in this small recess, you won’t ever look directly into them. Next, there should be some kind of way to exactly angle the lights to shine onto your desk. Mirrors, paneling, etc. , whatever works. Of course, these lights should have a sliding brightness control bar. One huge limitation of this design is the lack of mobility. Most lamps are rather easy to move, but this one you’ve really got to commit to before you start hacking away at your wall. But I think this could be a pretty slick way of light up your workspace, or maybe people will use it for their kitchens, bars, TV rooms, etc. Or maybe I’m just ignorant and haven’t realized that the world already has exactly what I’m looking for. In which case, send me the link so I can go think about other things. The word “sure” really sets me on edge. I associate with “sure” a derogatory or patronizing tone, because I’ve mostly seen it used in a kind of sarcastic or demeaning sense. For example: “Sure, we can definitely leave this to you. ” Other times, someone’s superior will say “sure” in response to some request. Typically this sure is overlaid with some overly nice tone that goes up to a super high pitch. When people say “Sure, I’d be happy to do that”, I always feel like they’re only half committing. Why not say “Yes, I’d be happy to do that”. Why do you need to provide the extra surety of “Sure” if not just to add an extra layer of protection against your word? “Sure” is a bothersome word. Except when I use it as “for sure”. Maybe not. 我逐漸地把尹雪艷的故事讀完。我一開始讀這一篇覺得非常難，每幾個字就要去查字典。但我勉強在讀幾段然後再重投讀幾遍就慢慢開始懂每句的意思。這樣就是成長的歷程，沒有什麼近路。唯一的近路就是找出更好的資料或導師領導你。這種近路可以幫你學習更快，也可以幫你維持正確的方向。但沒有勞苦兒的來的成功並不是成功，那只是幸運。但幸運也可以說是只有準備好的人才可以力用。你如果技術不足、積蓄不足、身體有問題，那也是沒辦法。尤其是身體不好。所以我覺得身體健康是最要保護的資源。 我最近又開始申請暑期實習了，真是累。每一個公司的申請表都不一樣。有些公司需要特別的帳戶，誰記得了那麼多密碼。有些申請表需要你把履歷上的一切抄上表。有些公司的網站非常差，載的很慢，或是 UI 很難弄，讓你煩到不想申請。哎，只希望這斷後可以找到值得我的時間的經驗。 今天的新詞：老當益壯 "

We laid out our meeting schedule for the year and discussed our plan for making this year better than the last. We were quite ambitious last year, and launched a variety of initiatives that largely ended up half-baked due to lack of time and interest. Some useful relics remain, like our new website and the series of slides on investing that I created. I also invited a bunch of speakers to help supplement our weekly discussions, which drew quite a bit of interest, especially from new members. This year, we plan to continue with our speaker series and to reestablish our industry connections. We will reach out to DFA, Western Asset, and PIMCO for company visits and other connections for speakers. It is our responsibility to educate and support our members, and making sure they know where to look for jobs is extremely important. We still haven’t solved the education problem, but I’m sure we’ll find some way to make the meetings useful and worthwhile for everyone who attends. Frequent communication is extremely important. I recommend biweekly or monthly meetings for executive teams, because that’s enough time for serious progress to be made on high-level objectives and frequent enough to pivot if things start heading south. We neglected to maintain a consistent schedule last year, which is partly why our operations unraveled. A new year brings new resolve, though common sense says that enthusiasm isn’t enough to carry the tide. Dedication and process are also important to establishing lasting habits. And I believe habits are the best force to fight against our inclinations to procrastinate, be late, flake, and demonstrate irresponsibility.

    "body": "2017/09/26 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Today was day one of being back at Caltech. My mind doesn’t want to be on school, but this is the plight I have put myself in with my lack of a useable toolbox. I’m not skilled enough to drop out and contribute to a startup. I’m not so much of a genius that I can easily support myself if the startup fails. But I will get there one day, through luck, skill, or both. A good mentor today revealed to me his three buckets for evaluating the worthiness of an opportunity: capital, relationship, professional. To be worthwhile, an opportunity must either promise you big capital gains, big boosts to your network, or a professional leg up. Boosts to your network could mean getting a recommendation or meeting someone who is very well-connected and is willing to share their Rolodex with you. A professional boost may help you complete a paper or get a patent. I think most of my current activities fall into the professional category, though I do spend quite some time networking, because I know that’s my leg up in getting job opportunities. I don’t think I’m smart enough to get in most places on skill, so I use referrals a lot. Three important factors for a good life another mentor shared with me today: health, happiness, and strength. Health is most important, because without good health, your life will be miserable. All the money in the world cannot satisfy you if your health is preventing you from enjoying your waking moments. Happiness is such a personal thing, but it’s very important to seek your happiness. Do not try to bow to the world’s ceaseless propaganda about sex, money, and glory, because most of the time, the pursuit of sin will corrupt you beyond your ability to be happy. You will be consumed with greed and forever dissatisfied. Strength is both physical, mental, and spiritual. You want to have a strong body so life’s daily physical activities aren’t a big struggle. You want to be mentally strong so you don’t get torn down by the world’s constant attacks on your ideas, your dreams, and your sense of self. You want a strong spirituality so you can ground yourself on what is important and realize your smallness in the greatness of God.

    "body": "2017/09/24 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I’ve been trying to push this product to the Taiwanese market for a couple of weeks now, since the Japanese market hasn’t responded well to my ads. I’ve even created an album of Chinese-language images which explain our products’ selling points just to excite this market. Today, I found out that our products cannot be shipped internationally. This is due to a FBA limitation. It seems all my effort was wasted. I think this result arose because I failed to establish a clear process for gathering information about this platform and setting up our product. When I was tasked with researching Amazon FBA for Japan, I basically searched “Amazon FBA Japan” in Google and clicked on every relevant link. I had no experience selling online, so I was trying to be a sponge and soak up all the little bits of information I could find on this topic. That worked out ok, and it got us far enough to have product shipped to an Amazon warehouse and ready for sale. But that process didn’t get me far enough to know all the details and pitfalls of our next few months trying to sell the product. I suppose this is ok, since I’m still learning, but I notice this behavioral pitfall in everything else I do. I tend not to follow schedules or routines. I just do things depending on my mood, which means I frequently skimp on important activities due to lack of time and that I am constantly frazzled because I don’t know what to do next. Is it time for me to turn to Atul Gawande’s favorite tool: the checklist? It would certainly help organize my thoughts, but I think my problem is rooted in my view of the world. I would rather be petulant and wish for a world I want, rather than be professional and work with the world as it is. Because of this attitude, I seek to maximize my pleasure at the expense of my productivity. Opportunity cost is massive with this self-destructive behavior. This week, I will try meditating to calm my mind and focus on what it is important. I struggle daily with what I value and what I am seeking in life. That is why I never know which opportunities I should take on and am constantly seeking affirmation from people I respect. I need to learn to think for myself and reach for what I love in life, because my life will be dragged from me if I keep dreaming. "

    "body": "2017/09/22 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I have so little patience with people younger than me. I have so little patience when people don’t get truths that I understand. This impatience stems from my difficulty in truly seeing the world from another perspective. When I think back on my younger days, I am experiencing the world with all the knowledge I have now. It’s like stepping into a Pensieve. I’m not actually embodying the consciousness of my 7-year old self because I don’t remember what it was like to be 7-years old. I can only remember what was going on around me. My experiential memory has been overwritten in favor of my current psyche. This is a huge fault of mine, because it’s caused me to lose my temper around my family and to act impatient around friends. I am not compatible with everyone, but surely there’s a way for me to master the art of decency. I’ve heard meditation is a good way to start, so I’ll need to find some way to work that into my routine. I am afraid to stand up to people when they say things that are wrong. I am especially afraid of people who are assertive. People who say “no” really emphatically and quickly scare me away. I often have no reason to be afraid of them. People who emphatically and consistently insist on their wrong viewpoint shut me up, because I don’t want to argue with them. It’s good to exercise tact and leave some things unsaid, but habits build from small actions. My fear is that, one day, I won’t speak up and fight for an important decision. I hesitate while writing that last sentence, because I didn’t want to add “that could change my life” or “that could change the course of my career”. How could I know what the impact of each decision is? Each decision I make, from choosing to go left at the intersection to signing a one million dollar check to invest in a company changes my life. And I can’t know how my life would have been different if I had made a different decision. My brain doesn’t afford me that kind of luxury to large simulations contemporaneously to understand each piece of my life. I’m grasping at straws to understand how to classify major life changes. Here are some commonly recognized major life changers:  Having a child Getting married Getting divorced Moving Starting a new job Death of a loved one Major injury or illnessA good friend of mine said that major life changers result in major changes in behavior or major changes in identity. That seems to be a good way to put it, though I would simplify by saying that major changes in identity precede major changes in behavior. To use the examples above, having a child turns you from a non-parent to a parent (the wording is weak, because I don’t know what you call a non-parent). Getting married turns you from a bachelor into a husband. Moving means you now tell people you live in Y city, rather than X city. Death of a loved one deprives you of meaningful relationships, and your loved one is now “late”. To cope with these changes in identity and the way you see the world, you act differently. You take new precautions around your newborn. Your schedule is now more tied to your spouse’s. You change your living habits to better suite the Y city lifestyle. You learn to cope with life without your loved one. On average, your next waking moment is highly unlikely to be out of the ordinary. But averages sometimes don’t actually measure anything, so be careful when thinking about your future. If you like my posts, you can check back at my website for a new posts.

    "title": "TechCrunch WrapUp",
    "body": "2017/09/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt TechCrunch Disrupt was, overall, a very enjoyable experience. I went into the conference with a priority to see what was going on in the startup space and understand what people think is important and a minor goal of finding a job. I’m a bit baffled by what people think is important, because there seemed to be excessive interest in things like blockchain and software gadgets and marketing ROI software enhancers and administrative software. There was one guy selling CRM software for dentists, designed by dentists. I understand the surface level opportunity here, just like the Yelp for Cuba startup, but … why? People who take action are better than people who just pontificate from their cosy desk chair, but these kinds of endeavors largely seem like wastes of time. The people starting these companies aren’t that young and they aren’t students looking to test their technical skills, so their devoting their lives to these companies sounds just a bit ludicrous. Then again, perhaps my mind has been so permeated by the Silicon Valley mantra of eat the world that I can’t comprehend developing an ordinary, profitable business that is useful but not game-changing. For a unicorn to be a unicorn, it can only appear once in a long while. In the meantime, while you’re searching, you’ve got to do something to feed your family and prepare yourself for the right opportunity. The world does not favor the idle; it leaves them behind. I’m happy that Pi won Startup Battlefield. They were well prepared. The presentation was polished, their demo was smooth, and the founding team handled questions very well. There were no awkward pauses or uncomfortable handoffs between the two founders. Some of the other startups had some serious holes poked into their business plans, like Materialize. X. I think most people walked away from that presentation more confused about how they use machine learning to customize adhesives to be more sustainable and effective. Oneva seemed to be quite far along, with a deal signed with Microsoft and ongoing talks with a country in the Netherlands. I can certainly understand attending for the free publicity, but it’s a bit of a waste of time for the judges and participants. Speaking of companies who leverage media for free publicity, see this Shark Tank video. The company seems to be doing well, but the Shark Tank appearance seemed like such a scam. I still waver on whether I want to aim for the stars and join a unicorn company with a mission to change the world and conquer its market or whether I want to just work on cool stuff, without as much of an expectation for fame and glory. I can do well in both cases, and I don’t want to fall into the trap of choosing an opportunity just for prestige or money. Most people work because they need the money to fund their lifestyle. I believe that if I offered a $5 mil lump sum to a bunch of workers in the US, most people who take the offer and never work another day of their life. They don’t care that much about their job and they feel their lives can be more enriched by the free time. The money is just a means to an end, which appears to be freedom. I want to achieve the freedom of not being a salaryman as soon as possible. I don’t have specific plans for what I want to do with the money, but I value my free time more than I value having something to do. I’m confident that I’ll find something I like to do if given the chance, and so far, I’ve been lucky enough to have confirmed my confidence. I’ve contracted with a virtual reality data visualization startup, I’ve started multiple online retail businesses, and I’ve started this blog. I think all of these ventures have been far more meaningful than my internships, mostly because I get to work on my own schedule, and I believe in what I’m working on. One day, I hope that I can be like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or DHH and wake up every morning excited to go live my life. I want to feel that excitement and purpose flow through my veins, because I want to see those around me live better lives because of what I do. 我今天從矽谷飛回聖地牙哥！下星期一就要開學了，所以我要快點準備搬進新宿舍。我每一次要回學校前會覺得很懊惱，因為我總是認為我待在學校只因為我的技能還不夠好，找不到工作。我如果拿到好的 offer，我早就退學了。 大學就像四年的夏令營，我對這種活動完全沒興趣，外面的世界精彩多了。 我這月剛開始在 upwork 上發案，希望能考自己的能力做出好生活。我不用靠什麼鬼公司，不用照公司的鬼營業時間去工作，我不必住在公司的附近、不必每天早上因為堵車而提早一個多小時出發。這樣的生活有多自由啊？我最大的問題就是找不到願意聘請我的客人。只好堅強下去，不能放棄，因為總有一天我能找出我自己的成就。 今天的新詞：癡心妄想 "

    "body": "2017/09/19 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Conferences are inherently exhausting enterprises. You spend a couple of days trying to network with and speak to as many startups and other attendees as possible while also keeping up with your favorite speakers. The condensed information sharing is useful because it will last you quite a while. I’d say the most useless part of a conference is the talks, because you can always go online afterwards and watch a recording of the conversation. Also, most of the talks I attended over these past two days, especially the ones I really looked forward to, were quite useless. This was largely due to the interviewer steering the speaker in rather unenlightening directions. For example, today’s interview with Sam Altman was not as eye-opening as I was hoping for. I have no attachment to Sam Altman, but with all the hype he receives as president of Y Combinator, I expected him to have some real insight into the state of the world. Most of the attendees, I think, were hoping for him to talk about OpenAI and some deep topics around startups, but the interviewer kept pressing him on pointless strategic things like where is Y Combinator going, are you going to expand into China, what are you political goals, etc. , and we ran out of time to talk about OpenAI. He did comment a bit on the bubble of cryptocurrency, but his response seemed to parrot what other well-known people have said about bubbles. Sebastian Thrun, on the other hand, was a really cool guy. I can feel his passion and his excitement about being a lifelong educator, which is something traditional colleges like Harvard and Stanford are unwilling to do. He’s also very excited about flying personal vehicles. I am happy that’s he’s passionate, and would love to work for someone like him with expertise and 	enthusiasm and devotion to the cause, but I think the airspaces are a much harder traffic problem to solve than underground tunnels. People already have enough trouble driving in 2-D, why add another dimension? I acknowledge his point that we already have super-fast direct highway from SF to LA (the airplane), but I don’t agree with his point that going from Palo Alto to San Jose by air takes 10 min while driving takes over half an hour with traffic. It may be true now, since you may be the only one using the airways, but once other people join, traffic will also emerge. Also, how do we coordinate flying pathways in the air? How do we ensure safety if two vehicles collide and fall out of the air? These problems are not really issues underground. Tunnel safety in earthquakes is absolutely better than safety above ground. The earth is great at absorbing shock. Besides, when was the last time you heard the metro collapsed during an earthquake? It’s always news on above-ground structures that collapsed. Perhaps these questions will be answered in the new Udacity class on flying cars, which was announced today! The most useful part of these conferences is the opportunity to network. You are placed in a crowded pavilion with tons of other smart people with the same general interest in the conference theme. You may as well take advantage of this captive audience to sell yourself and your ideas, because you never know what kind of opportunities will fall out of the sky. I am a bit disappointed by the companies featured in the startup pavilion, though perhaps this just reflects the current state of the world. Most of the applications feel gimmicky, like gadgets. There were lots of AR apps for trying on jewelry or tattoos or clothing. There was a diamond-backed cryptocurrency. There were five different blockchain companies, claiming to solve problems from debit cards to ride sharing tracking to general consumer use to patent search. I don’t quite understand the applications of blockchain. There is something there that’s cool, but this level of interest is simply beyond me. There were so many VR and AR gaming companies, releasing things from a Pokemon Go type Minecraft game (or is it a tool for architects?) to VR music to VR math to AR television (you use your phone to access enhanced content) to AR video dating. Then there were the tens of companies focused on SEO (for app store, for video marketing etc) and upping conversion rates and more efficient report generation and tracking “rage clicks” on your website and drinks on demand and travel planning (with different niches for nomads and traveling with friends and multi-city traveling) and the food discovery apps (Yelp for Cuba, some other restaurant discovery app). I don’t know what to call these companies, but they all have that same feel of sure it’s useful, but not really cutting edge. And then there were weird fintech apps like quantitative investing in fine art and crowdfunding for food and beverage and cryptocurrency investing platforms and voice password identity management. There were also so many app development or general purpose software development companies in the pavilion. Some were really just groups of engineers who make custom solutions and others were platforms like Koder, which help non-technical people with “good ideas” find technical producers. So many of these kinds of people approach Caltech, typically from MBA programs at USC or UCLA, thinking they have the next breakthrough medical records management app or whatever. If only they understood how trendy they were. I am using the word trendy to mean that they are in-tune with trends, which should likely be interpreted to mean that they are trend-followers. They have no hard skills, so they just repackage what they think is cool technically. And what they think is cool technically comes from the news, which is always at least 10 steps behind the cutting-edge. Perhaps I’m just jaded and too cynical to see the future, but I feel somewhat more depressed after attending TechCrunch Disrupt. Perhaps I should just stop talking, though, because at least these guys are doing something, while I just sit at home and theorize all day about what the world “ought” to be like. I still don’t know what my purpose in life is. I’d like to submit myself to God as a Christian and follow Him into everlasting life, but I still suffer from that nagging fear of missing out. Yet, if I try to find what I like in the tech world, I feel upset and lost because nothing really appeals to me. So many things, like interior design and architecture and VR and gaming seem cool on a surface level, but when I probe a little deeper into how I feel, I don’t know if I care deeply about any of these gadgets.

    "body": "2017/09/18 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Today, I got to witness the glory of the Techcrunch Disrupt atmosphere. It was quite a useful and fun experience, and I look forward to the next two days of activities. I really appreciated the geographic diversity that was highlighted, with companies from Taiwan, the UK, Japan, Uruguay, etc. in the pavilion. The organization of the startup alley and companies participating in the startup Battlefield was rather confusing, and I never ended up voting for any of the competing companies. There were some rather “unusual” companies here today. They were unusual in the sense that they tackle problems most of us would not be terribly inclined to discuss in public.  Sheisorganic, a monthly organic tampon service.  future family, a fertility care service with focus both on men’s and women’s fertility.  Some others whose names I don’t know are a breastfeeding pump company and a company that uses facial recognition to find illicit content (seems mostly aimed at pornographic content) containing you online. Future Family presented at the Battlefield today, and I wasn’t exactly convinced of their solution. Something about the way they answered a question about whether they are developing proprietary tests or repacking others’ tests threw me off. None of the other companies really jumped out at me, but here are some I thought were kind of cool or thought provoking:  Beeline, the smart compass for your bicycle. It’s a cute little device that I think I saw on kickstarter first. I think this could integrate well with Woole, the Waze for bikes that customizes routes based on difficulty of terrain and percentage of bike lane availability and other metrics.  Brain Navi, a guided surgical robot that is currently targeted for neurosurgery.  AlaMesa, Yelp for Cuba. This one got me wondering about how many of these software companies exist because the US version doesn’t yet exist in these geographies. It’s easy to catch up by copying. That’s how China grew so fast. They basically just skipped an entire development level of computers and credit cards skipped to the smartphone era. Chinese companies have had massive success internally, and China’s huge population means they have some time to go before they exhaust that revenue stream. But once you catch up, you’ve got to start innovating to stay ahead.  Pi, a wireless charging device that can charge multiple devices up to one foot away. I think the implied limit was five devices. After the conference, I went to dinner with a kid I met during the conference, Athisha Goh. He took a rather quick liking to me around 1pm, and we basically stuck together the rest of the day. I stupidly forgot a jacket, and was freezing to death in the San Francisco gales, so he kindly lent me his jacket as we walked to Umami Burger. My primary motivation for eating Umami Burger was because I wanted to try the Impossible Burger. This is a vegetarian burger that uses less resources to make than a cow-based burger and that should taste just like meat. I was disappointed in the Umami preparation, but the burger seemed to live up to the hype. If you are going to eat the Impossible Burger, I recommend you look somewhere other than Umami if you like your burger’s not burnt and your fries not covered in a rather unsavory mixture of Japanese sauces and seasonings. I will likely not be eating at Umami ever again. Mos Burger, on the other hand, still has my business. I am currently looking for machine learning or data science jobs. If you know of any such opportunities, please drop me a line. My data and info is on my website: http://xrdt. github. io If you think you have a non-ML or data science job that would suit me, feel free to pitch me. I’m willing to think it over, but I will likely only seriously consider technical or research jobs. 我不能再忍受睡眠不足的打擊了。我一整個暑假因為工作很早開始所以每天都只睡六到七個小時，這樣的缺乏累積到現在，我快撐下去了。我星期四回父母那邊就要好好地休息、恢復，因為我在學校的時期一定會受很嚴重的睡眠衝擊。 好多人都認為年輕時候這樣熬夜，活很苦的日子若不是應該的，是最好的一種經驗。他們的理論是妳趁現在身體還可以很快恢復的幾年去做一些比較刺激的事，去追縱一些比較有風險的機會，看你能做到什麼程度。這也是矽谷常聽見的思維，難怪這麼多有瘋狂夢想的年輕人都集合在這裡，想拼命地實現遠景。 但有些人，特別是 DHH，認為這樣是浪費青春。生命的意義不只是在這麽苦的日子下誕生。你可以跟他一樣，過一個比較輕鬆的生活，還可以鍛鍊出你的愛好。 我還不知道哪一方向對我來說會有比較好的結果，我的技術也比不上大多數的人，所以我好像只有拼命到死的選擇了。 我現在在找跟 機器學習 (ML) 或 數據科學 (data science) 有關的工作。你如果有知道什麼就業機會，請給我送個電郵，我的聯絡資料跟履歷都在我網站上：http://xrdt. github. io 謝謝您的時間。 "

    "title": "Expectations",
    "body": "2017/09/15 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I wrote the title for this post in a very agitated state of mind. My agitation was entirely brought on by the prospect of having my expectations dashed. Expectations are necessary to set boundaries on what is to be completed. This is the mindset of a lower-level employee. They need greater guidance and clearer objectives to orient their daily work. Higher-level employees function more in terms of processes. They seek to develop an organization with certain characteristics by enforcing certain behavioral patterns and social norms. Certainly, they have goals to achieve as well, but the goal tends to be further off and phrased more as a vision. The problem with expectations and goal-setting as your primary motivator is that you are enforcing an emotional rollercoaster upon yourself. You feel great when you achieve your goals, but you fall into a depressive lull now that you don’t have something else to do. You have to come up with another target to achieve. You feel terrible when you don’t achieve your goals, and the good feelings that come when you finally do achieve them (if you haven’t already given up) are diminished by the initial failure. This is why most people fail to achieve long-term behavioral changes. They are able to get to the level they desire (for example, losing X pounds or saving X dollars for retirement), but they are unable to create habits that will maintain or improve upon this level. They no longer have a distinct goal to reach for, because now the new objective is based in a process (for example, maintaining Y weight, adding Y dollars to your retirement account every paycheck). The process is sometimes just developing good habits. You rewire your brain to associate pleasure with your new lifestyle choices, and slowly build your preferences. The greatest achievements are largely the result of persistence and process. Work on your projects and your skills every day, and you will, over time, get better at them. It’s just that simple. The emotional rollercoaster associated with expectations has so far been disastrous for me. I anchor way too heavily on expectations, becoming uncontrollably angry and impatient when the possibility of failing to meet my expectations is raised. This is partly because I expect the world to work the way I want. I am petty and petulant, and I can’t bear to think that I don’t have enough money, power, or reputation to get things exactly to my specifications. All of these expectations are stupid, like my gripes with ridesharing. (I’m not giving up on the dream of car ownership, though. ) I must thank everybody in my life for having put up with my ridiculous attitude and arrogance and outbursts. Slowly, but surely, I am maturing and chipping away at the edifice of my ego. This post was partially inspired by this Farnam Street post on Amateurs and Professionals:https://www. farnamstreetblog. com/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/ Below are a series of posts regarding the power of FAGA (FB, Apple, GOOG, AMZN). The conclusions drawn are scary, and I mostly feel helpless, like “How can I survive without using Google or FB?”. But these thoughts are just the beginning of a revolution that some hope will be resolved with the decentralized future blockchain promises. I hope you enjoy the links.

    "body": "2017/09/13 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I have now separated the roles of my phone and computer. I started doing this a couple of weeks ago, because I didn’t want to be so distracted by technology. To start, I turned off almost all badges and notifications on my computer and removed all unnecessary apps from my dock. I then removed FB Messenger and Twitter from my phone. Today, I removed Mail from my phone. This was partly inspired by the Apple announcement yesterday. For some reason, after they revealed the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, I wanted to even further remove myself from this world of incessant, flashing lights and buzzers and pop-ups. My phone is now reserved for calls, voicemail, text messaging, Google Maps, Lyft, a Chinese-English dictionary, Calendar, Notes, and Pictures. I’m tempted to remove Calendar, but I’m so forgetful that this would probably triple my flake percentage. My computer is now reserved for email, FB Messenger, FB for work (I manage pages), the Internet, and coding. I hope this separation will help me calm my mind so I can focus on creating awesome content and tools and selling amazing products. Speaking of products, please take a look at Kanberra Gel (JP). Kanberra Gel is an all-natural tea tree oil air purifier that will clean your air like nothing else. It completely removes odors, kills bacteria, is antimicrobial and antifungal and antiseptic, and is great as an insect repellant. In addition to the gels, we sell sprays which you can use as deodorant, insect repellant, and hair spray, wipes, and soap. You can find us on Amazon US, Amazon JP, and our website. Goldilocks Ube Cookies. A coworker left some of these cookies in the office, and I’ve really grown to like them. They’re quite sandy and light. The sweetness may be a bit overbearing, but it’s slightly tempered by an exotic flavor of ube, or purple yam. You can order online at the link I included. "

    "title": "Art Keeps People Despair College Summer Camp",
    "body": "2017/09/12 - Today, I’d like to introduce you to one of my favorite newsletter compilers: Austin Kleon. Austin Kleon is an artist who lives in Austin, Texas. That’s about all I know about him. He’s written a couple of books on being an artist, which he frequently weaves into his blog posts and newsletter. He included a quote in one of his blog posts from Sarah Manguso, who is a writer. Again, I don’t know much about her. Austin pulled out one of her quotes: The purpose of being a serious writer is not to express oneself, and it is not to make something beautiful, though one might do those things anyway. Those things are beside the point. The purpose of being a serious writer is to keep people from despair. If you keep that in mind always, the wish to make something beautiful or smart looks slight and vain in comparison. If people read your work and, as a result, choose life, then you are doing your job. It’s scary to think about how fragile the human mind is. Most of us are on the brink of mental collapse, and each little burden we add to our daily cross pushes us closer and closer to that brink, where we can stare off the edge without fear and fall into eternal punishment. We use art to refocus our souls. I think Manguso’s quote is generalizable to other forms of art. We need art and beauty and nature to help us refind ourselves. As Steve Jobs said: If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things - that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. The constant chit chat of the internet, the buzz of the cars on the road, the vibration of our phone, the flickering screen of our computer, etc. It’s never ending, but you have a choice to make it stop. Take a couple hours each week to sit, reflect, and do something meaningful. Write something deep or just go deep within your consciousness through meditation. Try to locally optimize your life at every point for your values. No one can steal you away from what is important to you. Stand up for what you believe in. I have come to believe that college is a four-year summer camp. I feel like everybody around me is trying to perpetuate their youth while I am trying to grow up. I won’t deny that college has done wonders for exposing me to career opportunities and for rewiring my brain. I think it’s extremely important to lay all your beliefs down and reconfigure them every couple of months. It’s important to know the limits of your knowledge and your beliefs so you can build up strength where you need it the most. The best books are the ones that tear apart your brains at the seams, insert some new material, and have you try to find a way to put the pieces back together. You want to read books that completely turn your model of the world upside down so you can make that model more robust. Books that can be easily summarized into a long-form article, like the Gladwell books and Gawande’s book, are not at that level of profound. If you read Asimov’s I, Robot or Andy Grove’s High Output Management, I think you’ll understand. "

    "body": "2017/09/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Cynicism is a form of death for the soul. Those who are cynical have dulled their pain. They have reasoned it away by choosing to believe mankind’s failures are inevitable. Because everything is inevitable, they are now free to stop caring. There is nothing worth trying striving for, because everything will come to a miserable end, anyway. This is the beginning of the end for man. I lived much of my high school life a cynical fool. To use harsher words would be appropriate, but I am trying to control my tongue. I hated everybody because they were stupid to even bother trying when it was evident there was no future for them. They were not smart enough to lead the world, not smart enough to make a comfortable living, not smart enough to live without their parents’ significant support, etc. They were the stupid ones of my world. And I was the smart one, the one who saw through the fake niceties and understood true human nature. And yet most of these people were the happiest. I was the blind moose who was drowning in misery. I projected my anger and hatred and eventual resigned discontent onto everybody who seemed to be enjoying life more than I did. I simply couldn’t understand how they could love a life that was so cruel. Now I realize that there is nothing greater for a man than to be full of hope. There is nothing greater than the man who is constantly striving, constantly reaching for the next rung of the ladder that will lead to an existence more fulfilling than the meager one he is currently living. Our existence is defined by struggle. We are put on this Earth to fulfill God’s purpose and to spread God’s word. God is the light, and we must use Him as a lantern to illuminate the darkness and expose the truth. But the darkness fights back with temptation and evil thoughts and sin. Through our struggles, our faith is reaffirmed and we understand more clearly how we can bring glory to God’s name. Even if all hope is lost for you, there is still hope for others. There is still hope for your family, who eagerly await for you to join in their loving embrace, for your friends, with whom you join in fellowship and Godly growth, for your community, with which you plant the seeds of growth and nurture the next generation, your country, for which you fight for a set of common ideals, and your people, with whom you fight for God and eternal salvation. There is always hope, but that hope may not always be for you. To have hope, you must have emotion. And thank the Lord we were born with emotions. We were born with emotion to help us make decisions and to understand the world. Our emotions are good for us. We must follow Hemingway’s advice: “Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive. ” Let your emotions breathe life into your spirit. Let them flavor your every interaction. Let them enlighten your work. Let your emotions guide you to righteousness and truth and peace. Do not try to hide your emotions. Stop trying to hide your humanness and instead use emojis to express yourself. A static human face can never express the wild surges that can engulf you and possess you and give your life meaning. Seek the Lord with a humble face and humble heart. Let Him guide you in all your ways. Pray to the God for the courage to follow His path and the meekness to let Him show you the way. Amen. 我本來用隔兩天的時間表因為我不想爆肝。一開始，這種預防是對的，我還沒適應常寫這種文章，所以有一天可以休息會讓我腦筋恢復，讓我比較有寫字的激情。我現在維持一個月的習慣，心裡覺得很舒暢。我從來沒有成功地這樣一貫做一件事。從運動到做功課，我都是跟著很隨便的感情去做的。現在，我想成就更有意義的項目，最好的方法就需要培養好習慣。 我的暑期實習快完了。我雖然非常不喜歡學校的環境，但我非得回去。我還沒找到我喜歡的工作，還沒找到我喜歡的工作環境，只好回學校，等待著我的機會。看到那種機會以後就要立刻地去掌握，否則那瞬間以後再也不會見到。反正我最終的夢想是賺夠錢，逃離世界的束縛。 "

Casual dress, free food, ping pong tables, beer outings, and nap rooms sound nice, but they all help perpetuate the radically insular Silicon Valley startup culture. Why? Because all these perks demand more and more buy-in across the company for everybody to feel comfortable working there. As Rich Armstrong says in his post below: “When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. ” Work is about work. It is about achieving goals and shipping. It helps to not hire complete jerkfaces, but everybody can be courteous and decent without being best friends. We can get straight to building great software or connecting people or creating new ways to experience music. And if people want to have fun outside of work? So be it. Just don’t morph the idea of socializing into “being a team player” and “team bonding” so someone’s career depends on it. I don’t have many more thoughts to share on this, so just read Rich’s post.

    "body": "2017/09/09 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I was so tired yesterday that I forgot to write a post, instead wasting my time cleaning out my email by reading some backlogged newsletters. I actually had my folder of posts open, waiting for another post to join the list. I’m going to make up for my incompetence and lack of discipline by writing today and tomorrow. My early-morning internship schedule will soon come to an end, and I could not be happier for that fact. Starting the work day between 7 and 8 am slowly destroyed me with sleep deprivation, and as I worked more and more days, I started to show up later and later. I just couldn’t bear to wake up at 6:30am anymore. Eventually 7am became the new normal. Then 7:30am became the new normal because I stopped eating breakfast before work and would hastily pack some potatoes and bacon or sausage and fruit into Starbucks cups and eat them at my desk. I think it’s better for me to show up to work late and stay later than everybody else. While I do enjoy the feeling of getting off work at a time when the sun is still out and the animals are still scurrying around, I like the peace and quiet of an empty office better. I like it because when I’m in my cubicle when everybody else is around, I get nervous and anxious, thinking that every noise and rustle means someone is watching what I’m doing and passing judgement on my productivity. I am now strongly in favor of offices for everybody, preferably with windows and oriented so people are facing away from the door. This designed is inspired by some articles on office design and posts on hackernews about people debating the merits of open-office and remote-office structures. Some companies, like stackoverflow have also committed to offices for everybody. There was a particularly good article which included a cool 3-D floor plan where offices had space for three or size people, and there were private areas for one to two people and a big space which could fit everybody for meetings and lunches and other gatherings. That was cool, but I think the private office with glass walls was probably the best. I understand that many people feel strongly about maintaining the open stream of questions and banter and eavesdropping that comes with an open-office. But I will argue that most offices don’t need that kind of environment. Chat on Slack or Skype or whatever productivity you use if you need to give someone an impromptu tap on the shoulder. Especially for my current company, everybody’s work is so independent that we rarely ever need to speak to each other seriously about work. If your team is small and very interdependent, perhaps the three to an office structure mentioned in the above paragraph will be better. If you’re a startup without the money to give everybody an office, buy some Shoji screens and split up the space. Put in carpet to reduce noise and let everybody immerse themselves into their ideal productivity environments. Your people are your most important assets. Do not treat them like fodder to be fed into your money-making machine. Do not spout impressive values while taking actions that clearly violate every single egalitarian, humanitarian, meritocracy supporting principle you put in some slides and on your website. Your values are determined by the decisions you make, especially by the decisions you make about the people you keep in your company. Treat your employees with respect. Give them the resources they need to succeed. Read Radical Candor and High Output Management and Netflix’s Company Values and Ray Dalio’s Principles and figure out what matters to you. Please leave constructive comments on this document. I read all of them. If you have other comments, send me an email: ipacifics at gmail dot com. Look at my website! 我最近一直覺得我的工作很沒意思。尤其是我暑期實習快結束了，所以剛過的禮拜都在準備把我寫的程序交換給我老闆。我最討厭做這種需要很仔細的處理事。調試也是非常傷腦經的一件事，我的程序差不多做好了，那幾個故障我才不想管了。所以我前兩天就開始用工作時間做自己的項目了。 我這樣說的好像很有 vision，但我其實什麼都不知道。我完全不知道我對什麼東西特別有興趣，也不記得我的夢想放在哪裏，只知道我想掙脫束腹和責任，自由地遊蕩。生命好像是一種本來沒意思的活動，我們只是因為相信政府、錢、物品的價值才會簽約當某家公司的奴隸，把我們每一天的時間和精神給他們耍弄。有必要這樣做麽？我們的成就會從那裡出來嗎？你會因為工作上的業績得到真正滿意嗎？為什麼要因為這種東西驕傲呢？ 生命中最重要的東西是你自己要找出來的。我最近對神合宗教比較有興趣，因為我覺得跟縱神的道可以讓我找出我真正的身份，我也認為神的道是真理。 永恆的生命。永恆的愛。永恆的恩惠。這都是只有神能賜給我們的。相信神，當神的信徒，你一定會得到拯救。你的家人、朋友也可以因神的愛而得到最有意義的生命。阿們。 "

The Book of Life is an online book written by The School of Life, an organization dedicated to helping people develop emotional intelligence. The very first chapter of The Book of Life talks about building businesses for love or businesses for practicality. They are fighting against the flashy Silicon Valley mantra of “eat the world”. Remember that most companies will never break $1 billion valuations. The corner store, your favorite neighborhood pizza shop, the local bakery, are probably never going to get to $1 mil in revenue. But why does that matter? Isn’t your life better off for these businesses? Don’t you love going into these small, family-owned stores and saying hi to the owner? Don’t you like being welcomed by a community that knows, acknowledges, loves, and takes care of you? Maybe I sound wishy-washy, but I am in the middle of shedding my worldly skin and trying to rediscover my purpose. If I veer too far off the “rational”* course into the world of love and passion, so be it. Maybe that’s where the more meaningful life comes from. *How can we possibly be rational? Emotion guides and flavours our every decision. There is some research about a man who had a part of his brain damaged and could not longer feel emotion. He was completely rational. What is fascinating about his post-injury life is that he could not make any decisions. All the options were equivalent, so there was no marginal utility to choosing Cocoa Puffs over Frosted Flakes. I’m glossing over this very quickly, but understand that we need emotions to be human.

    "body": "2017/09/04 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Hello everybody. I’m currently working on two initiatives that would really appreciate your support. Please check out our FB pages: Oakie &amp; Vine: Wooden whiskey tumblers for the whiskey connoisseur Kanberra Gel Japan:All natural, tea-tree oil air purifiers. This stuff really works for getting rid of all odors, protecting against mildew, mold, fungus, etc. and for cleaning surfaces. Check it out today! I’m interested in hearing your thoughts about the two companies. You can contact me through email (ipacifics at gmail. com) or directly on the page. I’m also interested in hearing from people with Photoshop or other photo editing experience. The Internet is one massive attention farm. Everything about the ad-revenue model is focused on grabbing as many eyes for as long as possible. It doesn’t matter if the content is complete trash (hello clickbait) if lots of people look at it and click on it to see what’s behind the curtain. That’s why the Internet has pushed the limits of what people consider unsavory content. People are most likely to do a double take and want to learn more about salacious, violent, or otherwise unusual content, and that is what fills our daily feeds. (The adjective choice in the previous sentence was rather poor, and indicates a clear bias against the cute bunny photos people are also addicted to. Also add the weird ads with a hand-drawn banana turning different shades of ripe and the ads saying “Doctors hate him for X” and the ads saying “You Won’t Believe What This Website Has On You”. ) The more we expose ourselves to these items, the more desensitized we become to their existence. We need more triggering, more stimulating posts to give us those dopamine surges we crave about 20,000 times a day. The subscription model can help fix some of the nonsense by creating special-interest regions of the internet. People will gladly pay for high-quality, curated content. They will not pay for high-quality content mixed in with 10x as much crap. Ben Thompson explains this point well. He also has a nice piece on why ad networks incentivize the creation of bad websites. 我今天本來沒話說，但我現在想提醒大家去檢視父母的愛。世界上最愛你的人應該是你父母，尤其是你母親。她在你生日天拼命的把你生出來，然後從那天開始拼命的照顧你。你的朋友中哪一個會為你表現出這種愛？誰會記住你每一年的生日，誰會隨時等待著你的電話，誰會為你的什麼事而臨時坐飛機或開車去你身旁，誰會因為你要回家而準備一大堆你最愛吃的菜和幫你準備最好的房間，誰會每天都想著你、給你無條件的愛、把一切都給你？你還有見過誰會永久的為你犧牲一切，但不會不會叫你償還什麼？除了神的愛，只有父母的愛是這麼完美的。 趁現在去給你父母打一個電話，說一聲「我愛你」。你不知道那三個字有多重要，有多充滿愛的味道。不要等到最後一分鐘在表現出你的感恩。如果你跟你父母的關西不好或父母已經不在，你也應該還有其他對你很重要的人可以感謝。我們的生命不是獨自完成的。我們背後都有無數的支持者，朋友，同事，對半幫我們實現我們的夢想。 我以前以為最成長的人就是最獨立的。他什麼都可以做，完全不用依賴人家，人家也不用依賴他。他就是這樣過獨自悠哉的生活。我從青少年時就開始跟這個信念掙扎。我還是認為需要幫忙的人比較弱，但是那些友情最強的人是最高興的（交友最大的人並不止友情很深）。 而我者個總是帶著一副臭臉的傢伙每天都覺得很沮喪。我開始大學以後才認真的考慮我的作為，我的價值關。我還在因為這而掙扎，每天的情緒還是像海朗一樣，有時高有時低 (Life’s a Struggle)。但我一定不會放棄，我只有一個生命，一定要活出最好，最有意義的生命。 如果對我的寫作有興趣，可以在此稿上留言，或給我送電郵: ipacifics @ gmail. com 我現在開發兩家公司，你可以參觀一下我們的 FB Page: Kanberra Gel Japan:這是天然無化學物的空氣爭化器。我們今年五月終於在 Amazon JP 上開了店。你可以在我們的 FB 上跟我們聯絡或訂購我們的產品。我們有賣兩種東西，一個是凝膠，可以放在臥室，浴室，車裡，辦公室裡用來除臭，清除菌類，殺菌，還有防蚊子。兩一種是噴霧，可以帶在皮包或書包裡，隨時拿來整理頭髮，除臭，或清潔。https://www. facebook. com/KanberraJapan/ Oakie &amp; Vine: 對威士忌酒有興趣的人會很喜歡我們的新酒杯。這酒杯是用項目做成的，可以提高你喝究的經驗。你可以在 FB 上預購，今年 12 月 15 日會收到！我們肯定沒辦法寄送到亞洲的顧客，但在美國的朋友可以買來送禮物！https://www. facebook. com/oakie. vine/ "

    "body": "2017/09/02 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Here’s a piece by Paul Rand on design thinking as gameplay. Design can be better pursued when one knows the rules and limits of the game. With rules and scoring in place, one can measure progress, which is a great motivator. I have come to believe that part of our ability to find meaning and purpose in life comes from our interest in continual improvement. We like getting better at things, and that quest for continual improvement partly fuels our motivation to get up and work. But even the joy of getting better doesn’t completely satisfy us. We desire acknowledgement, so we will naturally drift towards pursuing activities with prestige or monetary reward or other signs of recognition attached. Money is a slightly different motivator than prestige, though, in the sense that people who need financial stability will pursue high-paying jobs that suck the life out of them so they can support their dependents. We also desire adventure and excitement, love, friendship, comfort, etc. But I think that for people who don’t have a “purpose” in life, continual improvement can fuel their journey to find their purpose. Keep trying things until you find something that makes your heart beat fast, keep you up at night, or just make you feel happy. “When there is any doubt, there is no doubt. ” (Ronin). Do not let doubt or fears hold you back. The journey is likely more fulfilling than the destination. Even paradise can get boring. Ok. Here are some gadgets that I think would be really cool to develop or own in the next couple of years: Foldable, rollable, portable screens. What I envision is that computers will shrink to be very small slabs we carry on our bodies. We don’t normally interact with this slab because we primarily focus our efforts on manipulating data through a flexible screen we also carry. We can adapt the size of this screen to what is most appropriate given our environment. This screen can be attached to walls or any other convenient surface. When we’re done with the screen, we can just fold it back into our pockets. Eventually, I expect the computing power will be in the cloud, so most people will not need to carry around the little slab. Perhaps what most people were hoping for is a device that is more intimately integrated with our bodies, like Google Glass or HoloLens. Contact lenses may become a new form factor. I suppose we may one day forego the real world and perpetually live in a VR simulation. General purpose haptic feedback gloves. Haptic feedback gloves would be awesome for interacting with the portable screen. I like my tactile feedback. 這週末的天氣真的很奇怪。從昨天開始就變得非常熱，超過華氏 100 度。在這裡住久的人都受不了，只好待在家吹冷氣。有些人肯定會趁這幾天去看看海邊或去附近的 Yosemite 國家公園找樹蔭乘涼。我還以為我今年暑假不會見到這種乾熱的天，因為舊金山附近的氣溫平常平均 70 - 80 度，很少見到超 90 度的天。但我只好忍耐一下，因為我回 Pasadena 的時候肯定也會是這樣的氣溫。 我要快點想辦法找出能讓我人生更有意義的職業，要不然我很快就撐不下去了。我不想維持我在學校拼命到死的生活。我也不想因為薪水不足而過一個艱難的日子。但我對我如今經歷過的工作都沒有長期的興趣，只想利用現在年輕學生的角色來補履歷。什麼東西都沒有價值，朋友也只是暫時的同伴，畢業後肯定會再去交新的好友。反正現在跟我又過往的傢伙對我的未來也沒有很具體的幫助。我只是因為需要同伴才會勉強的跟其他人交往。我如果成功到某一種程度，我什麼人就不需要了，只要一個管家幫我處理一些家常事。我這樣的夢想會不會太唯物？又可能吧。但我到那個時再來考慮我的生活決定吧。我現在沒有資格懷念還沒掌握的未來。 "

    "title": "Political Correctness",
    "body": "2017/08/31 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Today, I expanded my mind a little by reading Paul Graham’s piece on taboos. I’ve never been a fan of political correctness, especially since I likely hold conservative views that the liberals I am surrounded by in California would try to take a torch to if I ever voiced them (perhaps this is just a manifestation of my cowardice). A tolerant society cannot tolerate intolerance, but the tolerant society we are currently building is completely intolerant of any conservative ideas that even graze on ideas of gender differences, racial differences, income equality, etc. People like James Damore, who present their views without trying to incite a violent debate, are ostracized by their companies and peers for presenting opinions that could “hurt someone’s feelings”. Feelings are very real and should be given their space to be expressed in, but let’s not jump the gun and say that people should always strive to exist in an echo chamber of rainbows and and happiness. We should be real and genuine and allow ourselves to struggle with the pain and discomfort that comes with challenging our views. We cannot pretend that by isolating people with dissenting views that they will just disappear under the extreme social pressure to conform. They will not conform. They will brew and grow and feed upon their displeasure with society until they grow powerful enough to brainwash their believers into taking over the world. But they aren’t the only radicals in society. Those who preach and proclaim social justice and equal rights and shared humanity and trample those who believe otherwise are also radicals. Anyone who cannot listen to someone who has opposing views without wanting to raise a protest or physical harm or silence the speaker needs to temper themselves. Daryl Davis is a man who is practicing what I think is a great way to break down the strict, destructive barrier we have erected between the opinion conformists and non-conformists. This barrier leaves violence as the major resolving medium, as we have seen in recent protests across the country. We must reach across these barriers with our hearts, because beliefs are hard to challenge with reason. Beliefs are part of our identity. That’s why attacking someone’s beliefs about God or about gender roles or about tax policy is like attacking them directly. People get defensive when you challenge their beliefs because if they change their beliefs, they feel they will have to change their entire lifestyle. Once people get defensive, every subsequence action they take will be focused on deflecting pain. That is why we must make ourselves vulnerable when we seek to change others beliefs and hearts. We must show them that we care and invite them to also engage in an intimate mingling of the hearts. We must remember that most people just want to belong somewhere. If we look at Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, belonging is in the middle of the triangle. But I think most people who have achieved the bottom two layers of safety and physiological needs have skipped over belonging in their quest to achieve self-actualization and esteem needs. So many people, especially young people, feel lonely, even though they are surrounded by social media which leaves their friends away at a click. So many people neglect their family and friends to go pursue a job with higher pay, better growth prospects, more prestige. So many people have been sucked into the whirlpool of ambition and have no community to go back to when they fall on hard times. So, if you are going to become an agent of change in human history, you must remember to reach out through the heart. Inspire by motivating through interests. Inspire by demonstrating the tolerance that “tolerant liberals” proclaim to support. Challenge directly, challenge with love. I apologize if my post here was confusing. My thoughts on this topic aren’t clear, but my feelings are, and trying to describe my intuition is difficult. Please leave respectful comments. I appreciate any comments that challenge my views. I also appreciate any comments regarding writing style. If you want to speak to me more privately regarding my statements, you can find my contact information on my website 我現在同時讀兩個很有趣的科幻作品。第一是我上次提出的 「三體」。另一本是 浦沢直樹 的 「20世紀少年」。兩本的劇情完全不同，如果讀完一篇馬上換另一本會覺得有點昏迷，腦經跟不上心願。這兩本都很好，很值得你的時間。兩本的劇情都很深刻，會讓你再次思考世界發展的道路。 我幾年在一個資產管理公司做暑期實習。到此兩個月的經驗還不錯。我跟我的同事和管理的關西都很要好，還有我的工作環境很輕鬆，非常自由。我的項目是寫些文本挖掘程序，來找出能讓投資組合經理做出更好的投資決定。我們最今試過的方式包括文本情感分析 (sentiment analysis) 和語意相似 (text similarity)。最近的結果沒有特別具體的實用性，但我們每天的進步都有加上實用性的可能。 如果對我的公司更有興趣，可以到網上查一下資料 我現在還不知道我對金融還是技術更有興趣。我兩方面都有試過，上學期時有跟幾家初創做一些 consulting work，但我的責任沒有特別刺激，我也不曉得跟比較大的公司會不會更有意思。我現在有一種很麻煩的毛病：我很不願意聚焦在一個行動上，我最愛同時有很多活動，隨時有幾個選擇。但我最近開始碰到我精神的範圍。我沒有辦法專心地管理這麼多責任。但我想著，我還年輕的時候應該多努力，反正我還未找出我生命的意義，到那時後，不如什麼都試一試，總會找出適合我的工作。 今天的新詞：敦厚, 無所事事 如果有什麼意見，請在此稿上留言。如果有比較私人的評論，輕給我送電郵，聯絡資料在[我網站上 "

    "body": "2017/08/29 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Today, I’m going to start an experiment. I’ll write my standard English-language mumbo-jumbo first, then I’ll write a more journalistic piece in Chinese. Both of these pieces are designed to elevate my thinking in each language. My skill in Chinese lower, so I’ll start at a lower level of thinking and work my way up to more strategic, original writings. I want to talk about Charlie Munger, the man who is often known as Buffett’s right-hand man. So many people have discovered and come to glorify Munger that he rightly calls himself a cult leader. His 3-hour cult session for the Daily Journal Corp has vastly outgrown the capacity of the Daily Journal space and is seeping into all corners of the universe and financial meatspace. I won’t deny that Munger is a smart man, but I do want to caution people from attaching themselves too heavily to him. Munger has been right on so many times, it’s hard to see why you would bother searching for another diamond in the rough. Munger is now 93, but his ability to keep up with modern happenings and comment intelligently on just about everything is simply remarkable. It’s almost like the world and all its events are his orchard. Listening to him speak is like going with him on a tour of this orchard. He is the master garden keeper, who picks items off the trees at his leisure to comment on. I won’t deny that I am a Munger cultist. My writing surely has revealed as much. I certainly would have benefited from listening to him a bit more when making investment decisions (ahem Valeant). But the desire to imitate Munger has to end somewhere, so I can develop my own model of how the world works and how I fit into the inner workings. Imitation is a great tool because it helps you build up the fundamentals. Novice artists will imitate prescribed styles of drawing because those are the best ways of doing things. Young children mimic their parents’ way of speech. New people in a social group imitate their peers’ actions to get up to speed on the accepted norms and behavior. But to become a mature member of a group, you have to demonstrate unique thought and distinct ability. You have to contribute. I’m not entirely sure where I want to go with this piece, so I will stop it here and say that you want to surround yourself with people who freely share their thinking process and who respect you. A sign of their respect is that they are willing to be challenged and to challenge you on your thoughts. Also check for honesty, because smart, ambitious and dishonest people will seek to tilt the playing field so you fall off the edge (while they stand on high ground). 我最近又開始對科幻有興趣了。我到此為止最欣賞的科幻作家還是阿希莫夫。我總之是放不下他的 I, Robot 選集。我是因為他那一本含著深意的書才開始尋找科幻夢想家。我試過Philip Dick, David Brin, Robert A. Heinlein, Neal Stephenson 但還是找不到跟阿西摩夫有一樣默契的作家。雖然如此，我是認為隨時做事比沒做比較好，所以撿起一本最近很熱氣的中文科幻書。其實這本書是十年前出版，我是落後到這種程度才可說是最近才發現有這個作品。這本你們應該聽過吧：「三體」。 這本書的劇情你可已在 Wikipedia 上瀏覽一下吧。我本來不是因為被劇情吸引才開始讀這本書，我是想用這本書來提高我的中文程度。我幾年前，在高中的時候，發現我的中文程度以退步到一個完全要不得的水平了。但我對正常的教學方式和刻本沒什麼興趣。我一想到透過網路找對話老師就覺得非常羞恥，所以只好用自己的精神怒力去找 YouTube 短片，新聞報紙，書本，漫畫，卡通，小說，等等的資料去補習。我現在的手段沒有特別有效，但我還是能看見我每天漸漸的進步。反正陳腐的片語說：「千里之行，是於足下」。 我已經讀了五回了，現在已陷入道劇情的深淵了，在此斷絕會覺得非常不滿意，非得讀到底。ˋ但這也沒關係，像我在椅上說的，做事比沒做事好。有些人會誤會我這有點愚蠢的說法。我的中文還是不夠好，原諒我笨拙的解釋。我的意思是說愛找藉口的人 （太忙，太累，太麻煩，太無聊，太貴等）是永遠不可能成功的人。你要成功的話就是要持續不息的勞動。思考也是一種勞動。你不必每天都有清晰的願景或夢想或目標。你只要有一個廣大的綱領讓你走向差不多對的方向就夠了。 「你不必有希望而承擔，也不必成功而堅持。」“One need not hope in order to undertake, nor succeed in order to persevere. ” – William the Orange 你如果對什麼滑動有興趣，譬如說你對設計電動有趣，那你就要每天去進展你對電動的知識和技術。你每年做三百六十五個小進步會讓你超越那些怕爆肝或失敗的傢伙。你的成長，你的成就，是你跟神造出的結晶。你一定要去掌握你能控制的因素。 今天的心詞語：自尋短見 ＊＊您如果有什麼可提高我筆頭的推薦，請在此稿上留言，或給我送郵件。謝謝您。＊＊ "

    "title": "Make A Decision",
    "body": "2017/08/27 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I finally cleaned out my email newsletters folder this weekend. Over the past year, I accumulated subscriptions to about 10 different email newsletters services, half of which I hated reading. Because I hated reading so many of these newsletters, and because there were so many flooding my inbox each morning, I created a rule to shove them into a dark closet of my mail application. What this meant is that I never read those newsletters, even ones from sites I liked. So, over the past few months I accumulated over 2000 unread newsletters. That number is now down to 770 and will shrink as I consume my backlogged reading load. Why is this important? Because I finally made the decision to optimize the ratio of amount of information I gain to the time spent acquiring that information. Making decision is easy. Getting around your brain’s defects regarding change and inconsistency is the hard part. Execution can also hard, but understanding how to make change gradually by forming good habits makes the process a lot easier. Out of the sand in my inbox, I found a couple of diamonds. One of those diamonds is Stratechery. I don’t subscribe to Ben’s strategy newsletter because I’m a lazy cheapskate, but his writing is well worth your time, especially if you want to get a grip on your understanding of business strategy. He also runs a podcast called Exponent that is tonic for your ears and will cure you of any manias you’ve acquired from listening to the drivel that news stations broadcast 24/7. Enough of my maddening criticisms. I want to comment a bit on Ben’s piece about [Disney’s choice to break with Netflix] (https://stratechery. com/2017/disneys-choice/). The problem with Disney’s down-the-middle approach is that it doesn’t optimize for anything. You cannot expect radical change to happen if you don’t make the hard choices that align you with certain forces and trends. To optimize means to minimize or maximize; there is no minimize a little, maximize a little. You choose one side and you stick with it. This problem is also afflicting Apple, as it tries to demonstrate a strong commitment to services (https://stratechery. com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/). Apple, cannot maintain its relentless pursuit of perfection and brand control and create a services model which demands a looser, iterative delivery schedule. But culture is hard to change, because people are afraid of giving up their identities. The younger you are, the more flexibility you have in changing your identity because your reputation doesn’t matter. Besides, everybody around you is also constantly changing, so being a goth one year and switching to a hipster the next doesn’t faze your friends that much. But for older, more stable people with a track record, changing identities means invalidating so much of their reputation and believability that they’d rather not make the change. And so it is with Apple. Apple has such a strong brand of sleek perfectionism and a strong culture of functional organization that it’d be blasphemy to shift into a multi-divisional form that allows for distinct consideration of the core products and the services. But that’s a choice Apple will have to make. Whether Apple and Disney commit to profitable new ways of life before market forces sweep them away will be a test of their leadership. "

    "title": "Ambition With a Twist",
    "body": "2017/08/25 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt My post on August 19 glorified the idea of ambition and ambitious people as the driving forces of progress and change in society. This is a belief that is culturally passed down. The American Dream is achieved by those with the ambition and guts and persistence to survive in a new world and grasp the opportunity that lay across the river of hardship they had to cross to prove themselves. The New World was founded by those who were crazy enough to believe there was land over the edge of the horizon and that there were worthy treasures to be discovered and claimed in the American soil. Startups are created by those with ambition to bring their visions to the world. VCs are those crazy people who like to live vicariously through and support those with the energy, dreams, and ambition to transform the world. But what about the people who are content with their lives? What about the people who are happy to wake up each day to a familiar routine and live in a quiet neighborhood among neighbors they’ve known for decades, if not generations? They are placed further down the ladder of respect, because they didn’t take on as much risk or hardship or produce as much as the ambitious ones. I believe each person has a unique place in society and he should be celebrated for what he can contribute. As Wooden said, “Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming. ” Why should someone who achieved at the top of their ability be mocked because they weren’t able to produce like a top 1% worker could? Let each person find their place in the world and give him respect he deserves for his results. Of course, knowing yourself is a difficult problem. Being true to yourself may be easier, because you don’t have to distinctly qualify your uniqueness to know what feels right. But being true to yourself is extremely hard when you don’t have the freedom to pursue paths that are suited for you. Societal and parental and peer pressures can corrupt a person’s innate sense of self and push them into a less than enjoyable life. As Paul Graham said in his post on loving what you do, prestige is one of the ultimate corruptors. Any activity that is laden with prestige is done so because it is miserable. Finance, law, giving talks, C-level executive positions, etc. These positions are prestigious and pay well and come with all the glory and glamour of others fawning over you, but they will likely destroy your basic goodness. We must be careful to distinguish prestige from honor. Doctors, military servicemen, teachers, etc. hold positions of honor in society. The difference seems to be that people in honorable positions sacrifice themselves for the betterment of society. They add value far beyond the value they receive as compensation. You can look at some estimates on value-add for some professions at 80,000 hours I’m slowly starting to understand that some of my angst is caused by my desire to be simultaneously ambitious and content. I feel that I may not have what it takes to be ambitious and a top-line producer, but I also don’t want to live a reduced lifestyle because I have to take a lower income. It’s the classic dilemma of those who love to complain but don’t want to do anything to make their lives better. Slowly, but surely, my behavior and my mindset will change. I hope that progress is reflected in my writing. "

    "body": "2017/08/23 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I read an article today that was linked to by Hacker News titled Relationships Are More Important Than Ambition. The article argues that we should focus our time on cultivating a loving community that wholeheartedly and selflessly takes care of its members in good times and bad. The tradeoff is between following the call of ambition to take on a fast-paced job in a big city and travelling the world and soaking up all the world has to offer and staying near home, with the neighbors you grew up with, raising your kids, and giving back to the community that raised you. Sounds idyllic (and good for your health) to go back to the simple, slower lifestyle that some of us may nostalgically associate with rural or small town America. But that tradeoff is largely meaningless. The fundamental human need this article is trying to expose is our need to belong. We all want to feel wanted, appreciated, acknowledged, and loved. We want to claim an identity that feels right. We want to have a good reputation. We want to fit in. This need is clearly more taken care of in the small town community. In the city, everybody is individualistic to a fault. Everybody takes care of their own space and minds their own business, and life goes on as usual. This superficial veneer of the city relationship is also carried onto the Internet. Internet relationships are ephemeral, shallow, quick, touch-and-go, which probably contributes to the epidemic of depressed, phone-addicted teenagers that I keep hearing about. Emotional well-being is a need that deserves extreme importance. People who are free to express their emotions and take care of their mental state perform worse, and the performance impediment only grows worse with time. If you don’t feel like you belong somewhere, you should immediately look for alternative communities. Do not fret. You have Google at your fingertips and social media at your fingertips to help you search for the right place. Employers also need to be upfront with prospecting employees about the culture and expectations. As Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio explains in his Principles, you want to bring in people that you want to share your life with. If, at any point, you feel they stop being suitable for the role you brought them in for, you should fire them. But remember that any behavior changes you expect will take time. Ray Dalio says to expect an average of 18 months adjustment period. Always be evaluating your environment and circumstances. You are constantly receiving signals about how to adjust to a better position. Pay a little more attention to your environment and yourself and work towards making your life better than it is now. Our lives derive meaning from the struggle for improvement and achievement. Let this struggle for belonging and emotional satisfaction fulfill you and those around you. "

    "body": "2017/08/21 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I’m currently trying to understand what respect is. I don’t think I’ve ever internalized how to respect people or show respect to a concept. I’ve never truly respected the American flag, the American anthem, authority, or anything I’m supposed to respect. I’ve feared them and looked in awe at them and displayed culturally appropriate behavior that was drilled in at a young age, but I’ve never really understood why they deserve respect or how respect feels. There is an idea that showing respect is similar to being obedient. If you respect someone, you never speak out against them, speak up against them, or shown any kind of retaliatory action towards them. But that’s not true respect. If you respect someone, you should be able to stand on equal ground with them and push back against their ideas. Respect doesn’t mean deference; it means admiration. You can certainly admire someone and not agree with them. In fact, it’s great if you don’t agree, because learning happens at the cracks in your understanding. Someone you respect should have enough decency and dignity to respect you and your opinions so that you can carry on a meaningful discussion about your models of the world. Anyone who doesn’t respect you doesn’t deserve your respect. Relationships are a two-way street, and any negative behavior you experience means there are serious potholes and cracks coming up ahead. The same goes for behavior you exhibit. One thing we don’t appreciate enough is just how hard it is to change people. I think most of us want to believe in the inherent goodness of people. We want to think that, given the right circumstances, people want to help their fellow man. And that is probably mostly right. But we must be extremely attuned to the incentives that could be influencing someone’s decisions and actions. We must be extremely attuned to the habits that could be driving their actions. Those habits and preferences and responses to incentives are largely deeply ingrained in someone’s consciousness. While you may want to help someone break free of their prejudices and bad habits, the desire and impetus for change must come from within that person. They must realize their faults and truly want to make change. You can guide them on that path, but that job is mostly best left to professionals or others. Your time is best spent advancing yourself and your abilities. Don’t worry about feeling selfish or guilty. Unless that person must be a persistent force in your life, as a coworker, spouse, child, friend, etc. , you can always choose to terminate the relationship. Pick things back up when the situation improves. Back to respect. I think the definition of respect as a feeling of deep awe and admiration is pretty good. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to realize that respect was so simple. Well, I am glad I’ve finally realized this truth. "

They were kicked down by nearly every other person who took a look at them, but they persisted in showing the world their worth. It is these people, who live in the margins of society, who have the guts and the vision to make the world a better place. Their attitude must be cultivated among everybody, even those who prefer to live in the mainstream and prefer a stable lifestyle. Innovation is a responsibility of society. Here are some papers discussing the increase in corporate power that is part of the complacent class phenomenon that Tyler Cowen identifies in his book of the same name. http://www. janeeckhout. com/wp-content/uploads/RMP. pdfhttps://research. chicagobooth. edu/~/media/5872FBEB104245909B8F0AE8A84486C9. pdf Innovation and disruption and breakthroughs cannot be designated responsibilities of “Innovation Labs” or “Innovation Centers”. Every person must be constantly fighting for ways they can use their talents and abilities to build a better future. "

    "body": "2017/08/15 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt College is not the place for you to explore your interests. The entire purpose of education is to fill your mental toolbox with useful skills. For example, math and science and engineering principles that will allow you to perform meaningful work. Skills like critical thinking and qualitative analysis and speaking skills are important but are developed through practice and are hard to teach. As a student, it is my responsibility to make sure I take opportunities and develop skills that make me increasingly able to create my own work and vision for society or to fulfill another vision at their company. Each job and opportunity I take on is part of my portfolio of experiential investments. Each opportunity’s risk/reward profile should balance and enhance the value of the entire portfolio. These are the same concepts one encounters in investing with money, which is why I believe fundamental investing principles are an extension of life principles. I am going to pivot into talking about investing. The value of an investment is commonly described as the discounted value of its free cash flows. For stocks, this is frequently dividends; for bonds, it is the cash payments. There is a lot of trickery involved in building discounted cash flow models, including that most of an investment’s value is in its terminal value and that it’s extremely hard to predict growth and discount rates. One could argue that stable companies have predictable returns and are easy to model. I say, never take stability for granted. Stability one day means death the next. Anyone who’s read Jeff Bezos’s original letter to shareholders about every day being Day One for the Internet should understand. The world is constantly changing. Just because you achieved success 20 years ago and have managed to live off your profits and six sigma leadership structure and cost-cutting strategies for the subsequent 20 doesn’t mean you will live to see the next 20. Every generation brings a new group of hungry, angsty, dissatisfied humans who want to destroy you, uproot you, and overtake you. They don’t care about how you want to do things or how large your workforce is or who your CEO is. They just want to win. And that’s what you should be looking for in an investment. The investments where you are really going to make money are the ones where the founder is still in place, churning away at his vision to win and make the world a better place, the company is growing like crazy (frequently beyond it’s capacity to handle growth), everybody believes in the company (stock price just keeps going up), and you believe in the mission. Investing is as much a personal journey as it is a money-making one. You’ll discover all your heuristic biases over and over and over again, as you ride on the unending financial and emotional rollercoaster of the markets. And it’s good for you. Because it’s one way for you to live vicariously through the achievements and failures of great people. You have your pick among FANGTS (T and S for Tesla and SpaceX), the incumbent car and tech companies (Intel, IBM, Ford, GM), the banks (JPM, Wells Fargo, BoFA), commodities (oil, corn, soybeans), and so many more sectors. And you get to decide how you will support each industry by putting your dollar behind any of the companies who are fighting for supremacy in their area of expertise. If you don’t feel comfortable betting on any of these companies, you can choose from a variety of financial advisors, automated advisors, ETFs, indices, mutual funds, etc. There’s a lot of names on the market, from Motif to Wealthfront to Blackrock to Vanguard to iShares, and counting. Choose what makes the most sense for you, given your ability to handle risk, your financial independence, and your faith in the people who are running the world. Back to college. Focus on turning knowledge in action. Engineering and science and math are easily turned into action. Each of these disciplines is essential for driving progress and raising the standard of living. This is why reading is a dangerous activity. In fact, reading is the ultimate lazy person’s excuse. Anybody can claim they are reading and receive a quick nod of acknowledgment that they are being productive with their time. We do live in the Information Age. But, when someone grows so concerned simply with gaining more knowledge over using that knowledge to create useful insights or products, all their time and effort spent reading has been wasted. Every action must be purposeful. You may not have a plan for taking your knowledge now, but you must be able to chart a direct course that shows how this knowledge could be useful in a future endeavor. Reading math and science and engineering textbooks is useful because you can use that fundamental knowledge to build rocketships, design software, create a water purification system, etc. Reading science fiction novels, which shown to be correlated with the rise of high-tech CEOs, is hard to justify the ultimate use of. Perhaps science fiction novels stand above the traditional literature classics, though, because most liberal arts majors haven’t yet found a place in society that truly serves the populace. All those dreary, dense essays expounding the virtue and “The horror! The horror!” of Conrad have yet to enrich my life. Every day of your life should be spent improving your skills and your abilities so you can make a difference in the world. "

    "body": "2017/08/13 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt I am constantly struggling with the idea that money is not an end but a means to an end. I am so disappointed and frustrated and sick of being stuck in the quicksand of miserable work that I just want to escape and become financially independent. But, as Paul Graham says in his wonderful piece about doing what you love, finding your passion is not easy. And I’ve come to understand that anything worth getting in life is going to be hard. Anything worth living for or standing up for is going to be hard. So I’m not going to give up. I’ll slave away at whatever miserable internship or job or class I have to to build up a skillset that will allow me to have my pick among work I think will be enjoyable. I’ll keep producing results. The only way I can find what I like to is to just keep trying everything. Success is never wrought in one day, and my success in finding some work that makes me really enjoy life and makes me crave to wake up each morning to get back to my desk will not be wrought in one day. It certainly hasn’t been wrought over the years I’ve lived so far. One day, I hope to come back to my writing desk and say that I have found my passion. I want to come back here, overflowing with passion, and say that I have found my purpose in life. We were all brought into this life to fulfill a purpose to society. We are all rewarded based on our contributions to society. I hope I will be able to discover my purpose to society so that I create a world where my vision and my passion can be played out for the benefit of mankind. Awesome Paul Graham article about doing what you love "

    "body": "2017/08/11 - Author: Bianca YangEmail: ipacifics@gmail. comTwitter: @xdrtxrdt Produce results. Make things happen. Anyone who believes that the world is automatically going to continuously get better is either ignorant or stupid enough to ignore basic laws of physics and common sense. The Second Law of Thermodynamics clearly predicts that the entropy, or disorderliness, or the universe is constantly increasing. Humans have been able to manage this increasing entropy by innovating and developing technologies that allow us to do more with less. Every major development in human history (including the development of writing, gunpowder, the printing press, factories, genetics, scientific medical treatments, the steam engine, the computer, the Internet, antibiotics) has been accompanied by a great explosion in technology. Every major improvement in the quality of living is a result of better technology, better understanding of the sciences, smarter utilization of resources. (Awesome interview by Edge with Geoffrey West about his theory of the cycle of growth) The reason developing countries are moving so quickly is because they are playing catch up with the “developed” world. They can take our knowledge and our resources and replicate our success in their subsets of the world, but once they hit the transition point of independence, will they successfully pivot? China has proven it can. India, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, etc. are working their way towards the stability that defines the US. But why is this stability desirable? The US has been in a stability spa for the past 40 years. If you read Tyler Cowen’s latest book The Complacent Class, you will come to understand how dangerous our desire, preference, and encouragement of stability is. We are allowing entropy to build up around ourselves. But, those with enough resources have divided the world up into more manageable pieces, so they don’t have to deal with the unpleasantness outside of their backyard. I’ve come to believe that conflict is good. Change is good. Arguing is good. Discomfort is good. All of these things, for their own sakes, are fundamentally good because they force us to make mistakes. We learn more from mistakes than we do from successes, because we are forced to adapt. A fundamental building block of Darwin’s theory of evolution is that the species which survive were the best at ADAPTING. Those who don’t adapt DIE. We must never lose the hunger that lies deep in our bellies. We must never settle when we know where is greener grass. Be unhappy. Be dissatisfied. Be angry. Pack up everything and move to a different country, another neighborhood. Never lose sight of your purpose or your drive, because you must work hard to create a better future. "
